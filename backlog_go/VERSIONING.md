# Go module versioning and tag strategy

This module follows semantic versioning for public releases.

## Version policy

- `vX.Y.Z` follows semantic versioning for Go-facing changes.
- Patch releases (`PATCH`) are preferred for regressions, CLI bug fixes, and
  compatibility bugfixes.
- Minor releases (`MINOR`) include command additions or non-breaking behavior
  expansion.
- Major releases (`MAJOR`) are reserved for breaking command, output, or data
  migration decisions.

## Release tagging

- Tag from this repository history using Git tags that map to release artifacts.
- Tag naming uses the `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` convention.
- The CI/CD workflow should gate release candidates with:
  - formatting (`make fmt-check`)
  - unit tests (`go test ./...`)
  - coverage threshold (`75%` minimum)
  - parity/fixture checks for supported commands.

## Module compatibility

- `cmd/root.go` reports version metadata; keep command output synchronized with
  release notes when bumping tag intent.
- Release notes should call out command gaps clearly to avoid accidental support
  expectations.
