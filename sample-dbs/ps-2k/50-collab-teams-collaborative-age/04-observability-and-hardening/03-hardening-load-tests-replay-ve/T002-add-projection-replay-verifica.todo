## Description
Test: create team, add workers, create and complete several tasks via tool calls. Record get_overview, get_task_board, get_activity_feed results. Call Projection.rebuild/1 (simulating restart) with ETS cleared first. Assert all three query results are identical to pre-rebuild results. Covers: team state, all task states, worker count, activity feed entries.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Post-rebuild results identical to pre-rebuild for all three query functions
- ETS cleared before rebuild confirmed
- test covers minimum: team state, task counts by state, worker count
- async: true
