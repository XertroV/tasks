# Extract shared HTTP client patterns from integrations

## Description

Identify and extract common HTTP client patterns from integration modules (GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins, Gitea, Matrix) into a shared utility module. Reduce code duplication.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Audit all integration modules for shared HTTP patterns
- [ ] Identify common patterns: auth headers, error handling, retries, rate limiting
- [ ] Create `lib/pag_server/integrations/http_client.ex` or similar
- [ ] Extract at least 3 shared patterns
- [ ] Refactor 2+ integration modules to use shared client
- [ ] All integration tests pass
- [ ] Lint passes

## Context

- Related files: `lib/pag_server/integrations/*/` directories
- Focus on: GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins, Gitea integrations
- Patterns: Bearer token auth, error response handling, retry logic
- Part of epic: Complete TODO Implementations
