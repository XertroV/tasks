# Refactor classify_intent/1 (complexity 15)

## Description

Reduce the cyclomatic complexity of `classify_intent/1` in the retrieval pipeline. Current complexity of 15 indicates too many branching paths. Simplify and extract helper functions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Analyze current function and identify complexity sources
- [ ] Extract pattern matching logic into separate functions
- [ ] Consider using a dispatch table or pattern-based approach
- [ ] Maintain same classification behavior
- [ ] Target complexity: reduce to <= 10
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] Lint passes

## Context

- Related files: `lib/pag_server/retrieval/pipeline.ex`
- Function: `classify_intent/1`
- May involve intent classification helpers
- Part of epic: Refactor Complex Functions
