# Implement tool search and filtering



## Requirements

- [ ] Add `GET /api/v1/tools/search` endpoint for flexible tool discovery
- [ ] Support full-text search on tool names and descriptions
- [ ] Support filtering by multiple criteria: category, tags, enabled, capability
- [ ] Support sorting by: name, created_at, updated_at, usage_count
- [ ] Return ranked results with relevance scores for search queries
- [ ] Support combining search with filters (e.g., search + category)
- [ ] Include usage statistics in results (calls, errors, avg duration)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Search query parameter returns matching tools ranked by relevance
- [ ] Multi-filter combinations work (e.g., `?category=file&tags=read,write`)
- [ ] Sorting parameters work on all major fields
- [ ] Results include usage stats (calls_24h, error_rate, avg_duration_ms)
- [ ] Returns 400 for invalid filter combinations
- [ ] Pagination works with search and filters
- [ ] Performance: searches complete in <500ms for typical queries
- [ ] Tests cover edge cases: empty search, special characters, multiple filters
