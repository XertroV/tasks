# Implement private volume mounting with agent isolation

Implement the private volume that is unique to each agent.

## Requirements

- Mount private area at `/private` in container
- Private path: `<workspace_root>/.agents/<agent_id>/private`
- Isolated per-agent - not shared by default
- Created on-demand when agent starts

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Private volume mounts to `/private` in container
- [ ] Host path: `<workspace>/.agents/<agent_id>/private`
- [ ] Directory created if doesn't exist
- [ ] Proper file permissions (agent-owned)
- [ ] Not accessible by other agents unless sibling sharing enabled
- [ ] Cleanup on agent stop is configurable
- [ ] Unit tests for private mount computation
