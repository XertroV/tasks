# Create Gitea API client

Implement HTTP client module for Gitea API integration with authentication and repository operations.

## Requirements

- [ ] Create `lib/pag_server/integrations/gitea/client.ex` module
- [ ] Implement Gitea API authentication (token-based)
- [ ] Define HTTP request builder functions:
  - [ ] Create pull request
  - [ ] Get PR status
  - [ ] List issues
  - [ ] Comment on PR/issue
  - [ ] Get repository info
- [ ] Implement error handling for API failures
- [ ] Add request/response logging and telemetry
- [ ] Write comprehensive module tests

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Client module compiles with no warnings
- [ ] Supports Gitea API endpoints
- [ ] Implements retry logic for transient failures
- [ ] All HTTP calls include telemetry tracking
- [ ] Error responses wrapped in standardized tuples
- [ ] Unit tests cover happy path and errors
- [ ] `mix test` passes for all client tests
- [ ] `mix lint` passes without warnings


## Delegation Instructions

**Delegated to subagent by**: cli-user (primary agent)
**Delegation date**: 2026-02-12 05:27 UTC
**Primary task**: P10.M5.E1.T001 - Create Bitbucket API client

**Instructions**:
This task was claimed as part of a multi-task batch. The primary agent (cli-user)
should spawn a subagent to complete this task in parallel.

**Recommended approach**:
1. Use the Task tool with subagent_type to create a dedicated agent
2. Provide context from this task file as the prompt
3. Grant necessary tools for task completion
4. Monitor subagent progress
5. Aggregate results upon completion

**Independence verification**:
- Different epic: ✓ (P10.M5.E2 vs P10.M5.E1)
- No dependency chain: ✓ (verified at claim time)
