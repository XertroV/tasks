# Design generic CI/CD webhook interface

Design abstraction layer for handling webhooks from various CI/CD platforms.

## Requirements

- [ ] Design `PagServer.Integrations.CiCd.WebhookAdapter` behaviour
- [ ] Define standard webhook event interface:
  - [ ] Build/pipeline ID
  - [ ] Status (pending, running, success, failure)
  - [ ] Timestamp information
  - [ ] URL/log references
  - [ ] Associated repository/project info
- [ ] Document platform-specific implementations:
  - [ ] CircleCI adapter mapping
  - [ ] Jenkins adapter mapping
  - [ ] Drone adapter mapping
- [ ] Design event routing based on webhook type
- [ ] Document signature verification patterns
- [ ] Create adapter integration tests

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Behaviour module defined with required callbacks
- [ ] Standard event struct supports all platform variations
- [ ] Platform mappings clearly documented
- [ ] Routing logic handles different event schemas
- [ ] Example implementations for each platform
- [ ] Integration tests verify adapter pattern works
- [ ] `mix test` passes for all tests
- [ ] `mix lint` passes without warnings


## Sibling Batch Instructions

**Batch mode**: siblings (same epic: P10.M4.E4)
**Agent**: cli-user
**Date**: 2026-02-12 05:07 UTC
**Sibling tasks**: P10.M4.E4.T002

**Instructions**:
This task is part of a sibling batch from the same epic.
Spawn ONE subagent to implement ALL sibling tasks sequentially.
Work through tasks in order: P10.M4.E4.T001 → P10.M4.E4.T002
Mark each done individually after completion.

**Task files**:
- P10.M4.E4.T001: .tasks/10-devops-developer-tool-integrat/04-ci-cd-platform-integrations/04-generic-ci-cd-webhook-handler/T001-design-generic-ci-cd-webhook-i.todo
- P10.M4.E4.T002: .tasks/10-devops-developer-tool-integrat/04-ci-cd-platform-integrations/04-generic-ci-cd-webhook-handler/T002-implement-common-ci-cd-operati.todo
