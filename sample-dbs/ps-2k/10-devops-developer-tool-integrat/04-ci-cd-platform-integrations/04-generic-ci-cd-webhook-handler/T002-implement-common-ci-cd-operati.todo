# Implement common CI/CD operations abstraction

Implement unified interface for common CI/CD operations across all platforms.

## Requirements

- [ ] Create `PagServer.Integrations.CiCd.Orchestrator` behaviour
- [ ] Define common operations:
  - [ ] Trigger build/pipeline
  - [ ] Get build status
  - [ ] Retrieve logs
  - [ ] Cancel running build
- [ ] Implement platform detection and routing
- [ ] Create adapter implementations for CircleCI, Jenkins, Drone
- [ ] Add retry logic and error handling
- [ ] Document API with examples
- [ ] Write integration tests for each adapter

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Behaviour module defined with common operations
- [ ] Platform routing works for all supported platforms
- [ ] Each adapter correctly implements callback functions
- [ ] Retry logic handles transient failures
- [ ] Error types standardized across adapters
- [ ] Integration tests verify all adapter paths
- [ ] `mix test` passes for all tests
- [ ] `mix lint` passes without warnings
