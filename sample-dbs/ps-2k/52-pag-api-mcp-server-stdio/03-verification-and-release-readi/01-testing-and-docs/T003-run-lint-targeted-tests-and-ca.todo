# Run lint/targeted tests and capture launch checklist

## Verification Notes

- Ran focused MCP verification suite (appended to `recent-mix-tests.log`):
  - `mix test test/pag_server/mcp/stdio_flow_integration_test.exs test/pag_server/mcp/api_bridge_test.exs test/pag_server/mcp/target_resolver_test.exs test/pag_server/mcp/stdio_runtime_config_test.exs test/pag_server/mcp/stdio_server_test.exs test/pag_server/tools/mcp/messages_test.exs test/pag_server/tools/mcp/protocol_handler_test.exs`
  - Result: 128 tests, 0 failures.
- Ran subsystem/changed checks:
  - `mix test.changed` (fails due pre-existing unrelated failures in dirty changed paths outside MCP scope)
  - `mix test.tools` (shows pre-existing unrelated approval-manager sandbox ownership instability; MCP-specific tests remain green)
- Ran `mix lint`:
  - Credo reports existing repo-wide warnings.
  - MCP-attributable Credo findings introduced during this work were fixed (`api_bridge` redundant with clauses and `stdio_server` single-condition cond usage).

## Launch Checklist

- Added launch checklist document: `docs/guides/mcp-stdio-launch-checklist.md`
- Checklist includes:
  - pre-launch validation
  - canonical verification commands
  - known v1 limits
  - rollback/fallback plan



## Requirements

- Run lint and targeted test suites for all changed MCP modules.
- Capture launch checklist for first rollout, including known limits and fallback plan.
- Record verification artifacts in task notes and `recent-mix-tests.log`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `mix lint` passes for this scope, or repo-baseline lint failures are documented with confirmation of no new MCP-attributable issues.
- Targeted tests and `mix test.changed` pass or have documented pre-existing failures.
- Launch checklist is complete and linked from this task for handoff.
