# Document setup, auth, and example client wiring

## Implementation Notes

- Added guide: `docs/guides/mcp-stdio-bridge.md`.
- Documented:
  - startup commands (`mix pag.mcp.stdio`)
  - auth + runtime config (CLI/env/config-file)
  - deterministic config precedence rules
  - default workspace/session targeting behavior
  - concrete MCP client wiring example (Claude Desktop style)
  - initialize and `tools/call` request/response snippets
  - troubleshooting for auth, target validation, and transport/API failures

## Verification Notes

- Command examples and env variables were validated against current runtime implementation in:
  - `lib/mix/tasks/pag.mcp.stdio.ex`
  - `lib/pag_server/mcp/stdio_runtime_config.ex`
  - `lib/pag_server/mcp/api_bridge.ex`
  - `lib/pag_server/mcp/target_resolver.ex`



## Requirements

- Document local setup, required environment variables, and startup commands.
- Provide at least one concrete MCP client wiring example (CLI/editor integration).
- Include troubleshooting notes for common auth/config and transport failures.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Documentation lives in repo docs with command examples that match implemented runtime.
- Example request/response snippets are included for initialize and at least one tool call.
- Troubleshooting section covers top failure modes discovered during testing.
