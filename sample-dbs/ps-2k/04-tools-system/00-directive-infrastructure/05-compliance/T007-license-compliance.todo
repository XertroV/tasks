### What We Use

PAG-Server's directive-based tool system is inspired by and adapted from Jido's
directive pattern architecture. Specifically:

- Directive struct pattern (pure data describing effects)
- Protocol-based directive execution
- Pure function testing approach for tools
- Parent-child agent hierarchy concepts

### Modifications

PAG-Server modified these patterns for our specific needs:

- Added event sourcing for directive persistence and replay
- Integrated with existing EventStore and event-driven architecture
- Modified blocking behavior to use Task.async instead of Jido's approach
- Added LLM-specific integration points in AgentServer
- Custom directive types for LLM agent coordination

### README.md Acknowledgments section

```markdown
## Acknowledgments

PAG-Server's directive-based tool system is inspired by and adapted from
[Jido](https://github.com/agentjido/jido) by Parker Selbert, licensed under
the Apache License 2.0.

Jido's elegant directive pattern for pure functional agents influenced our
architecture significantly. We modified these patterns for event sourcing,
LLM integration, and multi-agent coordination. See [THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md](./THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md)
for complete attribution and license details.
```

### File-level attribution header template

```elixir
# lib/pag_server/agents/directive.ex
# Directive pattern adapted from Jido (https://github.com/agentjido/jido)
# Copyright 2019 Parker Selbert - Apache License 2.0
# Modified for PAG-Server event-sourced architecture

defmodule PagServer.Agents.Directive do
  # ...
end
```

### Files requiring headers

- `lib/pag_server/agents/directive.ex`
- `lib/pag_server/agents/directive/*.ex` (all directive struct modules)
- `lib/pag_server/agents/directive/executor.ex`

### Checklist before merge

- [ ] THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md created
- [ ] Apache 2.0 full text included (verify all 201 lines)
- [ ] Jido copyright notice present
- [ ] README.md acknowledgment added
- [ ] All directive files have attribution headers
- [ ] Modifications documented
- [ ] Links to Jido repo working

## Delegation Instructions

**Delegated to subagent by**: claude-1 (primary agent)
**Delegation date**: 2026-02-06 06:15 UTC
**Primary task**: P2.M7.E3.T002 - Write end-to-end cost tests

**Instructions**:
This task was claimed as part of a multi-task batch. The primary agent (claude-1)
should spawn a subagent to complete this task in parallel.

**Recommended approach**:
1. Use the Task tool with subagent_type to create a dedicated agent
2. Provide context from this task file as the prompt
3. Grant necessary tools for task completion
4. Monitor subagent progress
5. Aggregate results upon completion

**Independence verification**:
- Different epic: ✓ (P4.M0.E5 vs P2.M7.E3)
- No dependency chain: ✓ (verified at claim time)
