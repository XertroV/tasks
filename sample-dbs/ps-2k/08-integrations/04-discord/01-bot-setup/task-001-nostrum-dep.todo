# Add Nostrum dependency

Add Nostrum library to mix.exs for Discord bot integration.
Nostrum is the Elixir Discord library that handles WebSocket connections,
API requests, and event handling.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Nostrum added to mix.exs dependencies
- [x] Dependencies fetched with mix deps.get
- [x] No version conflicts with existing dependencies
- [x] Dependency compiles successfully

## Notes

Reference: .plan/2026-02-05-velvet-cascade/integrations.md:289-351

Add to mix.exs:
```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:nostrum, "~> 0.10"}
  ]
end
```

Nostrum handles:
- Discord Gateway WebSocket connection
- Voice and text channel events
- REST API wrapper
- Rate limiting
- Automatic reconnection


## Delegation Instructions

**Delegated to subagent by**: cli-user (primary agent)
**Delegation date**: 2026-02-08 10:20 UTC
**Primary task**: P8.M5.E2.T001 - Implement webhook verification endpoint

**Instructions**:
This task was claimed as part of a multi-task batch. The primary agent (cli-user)
should spawn a subagent to complete this task in parallel.

**Recommended approach**:
1. Use the Task tool with subagent_type to create a dedicated agent
2. Provide context from this task file as the prompt
3. Grant necessary tools for task completion
4. Monitor subagent progress
5. Aggregate results upon completion

**Independence verification**:
- Different epic: ✓ (P8.M4.E1 vs P8.M5.E2)
- No dependency chain: ✓ (verified at claim time)
