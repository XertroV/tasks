## Campaign: Can everything load?

The most basic check. Navigate to every dashboard page and verify it renders without 500 errors, JS crashes, or blank screens.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All pages below visited; bugs filed for any that crash or 500
- [x] Missing features / blank stubs documented (expected at pre-alpha)
- [x] Quick fixes applied inline with 'backlog fixed <ID>' where trivial

## Test Sequence (simple → complex)

### Round 1: Unauthenticated pages
1. GET / — does the root path redirect or render?
2. GET /login — does the OAuth login page render with provider buttons?
3. GET /health or /api/v1/status — does a health endpoint respond?

### Round 2: Authenticated dashboard pages (requires login)
For each page, verify: page loads, no JS console errors, main content renders
- /dashboard/
- /dashboard/agents
- /dashboard/agent-manager
- /dashboard/validation-console
- /dashboard/events
- /dashboard/settings
- /dashboard/settings/profile
- /dashboard/platform-config
- /dashboard/plugin-settings
- /dashboard/workspaces
- /dashboard/workflow-templates
- /dashboard/models-pricing
- /dashboard/llm-calls
- /dashboard/skills/hub
- /dashboard/graphiti-wall

### Round 3: Note which pages are stubs/empty
- Document every 'Not implemented yet' or blank panel
- File a low-severity bug for each with area tag
- Mark fixed immediately if a trivial fix is visible

## Outcome
A census of which pages work. Required before deeper testing.

## Execution Notes (2026-02-20)
- Round 1 unauth caveat: in dev/permissive mode the UI auto-logs into admin, so `/login` OAuth button UI cannot be observed in a stable unauth state.
- Health check validated with `/health` (`{"status":"ok","version":"0.1.0"}`); `/api/v1/status` is not implemented in this branch.
- Round 2 dashboard routes visited end-to-end; one critical failure found and filed as `B161` (`.tasks/bugs/B161-skill-hub-liveview-crashes-in.todo`).
- No trivial inline fixes were performed during this task.
