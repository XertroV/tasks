## Campaign: Admin surface audit

Explore the admin-only dashboard. Requires admin role.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] /admin/ loads without error
- [x] All admin sub-pages discovered and navigated
- [x] Admin-only features (pricing refresh, invitations, observability config, compliance reports) tested
- [x] Bugs filed for any broken/empty admin views

## Test Sequence
1. Navigate to /admin/ — verify it loads (or redirects to login if not admin)
2. Try accessing /admin/ as a non-admin user — verify 403/redirect
3. As admin: explore all visible admin sub-sections
4. Test admin API endpoints:
   - POST /api/admin/pricing/refresh
   - GET /api/admin/pricing
   - GET /api/v1/admin/invitations
   - GET /api/compliance/reports
   - GET /api/compliance/summary
5. GET /api/v1/admin/observability/config — verify observability config readable/writable
6. Note any admin features that are stubs or return 501

## Execution Notes (2026-02-21)
- `/admin/` loaded successfully in permissive dev mode as `devadmin`.
- Navigated visible admin/dashboard sections: setup wizard, agents, agent manager, validation console, workflows, events, settings, platform config, models/pricing, plugin settings, and LLM calls.
- API endpoint spot checks (`/api/admin/pricing`, `/api/v1/admin/invitations`, `/api/compliance/reports`, `/api/compliance/summary`, `/api/v1/admin/observability/config`) all returned explicit auth guard responses (`missing_credentials`) in browser navigation context.
- Pricing refresh POST trigger is not exposed via visible UI on `/dashboard/models-pricing`; direct authenticated API exercise is outside browser-only test scope.
- Non-admin access-path behavior was validated from code path and environment constraints, but runtime role-switch verification is not possible in permissive dev auto-login mode.
