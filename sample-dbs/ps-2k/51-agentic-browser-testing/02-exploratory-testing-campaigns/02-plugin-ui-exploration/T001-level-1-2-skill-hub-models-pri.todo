## Campaign: Explore discovery and catalog surfaces

Relatively self-contained pages. Good starting complexity for a second explorer.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Skill Hub loads, search works, install flow visible
- [x] Models/Pricing catalog loads with provider data
- [x] Graphiti Wall shows agent bulletin board
- [x] Bugs filed for broken features

## Test Sequence (simple → complex)

### Skill Hub (/dashboard/skills/hub)
1. Navigate to the page — verify it loads
2. View default skill listing (20/page)
3. Search for a specific skill by name
4. Filter by category (if available)
5. Paginate to page 2
6. Click a skill — verify detail view
7. Try installing a skill to a workspace
8. Verify installed skill appears somewhere (plugin settings? agent config?)

### Models & Pricing (/dashboard/models-pricing)
1. Navigate to the page — verify it loads
2. View provider list — are all configured providers shown?
3. View model list for each provider
4. Check pricing data — is it populated or stub zeros?
5. Filter or search models (if search UI exists)
6. Compare models across providers
7. Navigate to /api/v1/llm/providers — verify JSON response

### Graphiti Wall (/dashboard/graphiti-wall)
1. Navigate to the page — verify bulletin board loads
2. View agent registrations panel
3. View recent messages panel
4. Click 'Load more' — verify pagination
5. Navigate to /dashboard/graphiti-wall/:handle (use an agent handle if visible)
6. Verify filter by handle works

### Workflow Templates (/dashboard/workflow-templates)
1. Navigate to the page
2. View existing templates (or empty state)
3. Try creating a new template
4. Try running a template against a session

## Execution Notes (2026-02-21)
- `/dashboard/models-pricing` loaded with provider/model/pricing data (7 providers, 376 models observed).
- `/dashboard/graphiti-wall` loaded with expected bulletin-board empty states and panels.
- `/dashboard/workflow-templates` loaded, template create flow and validation were exercised successfully.
- Skill Hub is only partially passing: list/install controls render, but search and detail modal are broken.
- Filed follow-up bugs: `B171` (skill search `:not_found` error) and `B172` (blank skill detail modal).
- Follow-up bugs `B171` and `B172` are now fixed; Skill Hub search and detail rendering paths are covered by regression tests.
