## Purpose
Work through the prioritized bug list. P0 first, then P1. Fix agents can run in parallel when bugs are in different areas.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All P0 bugs resolved (or escalated with explanation if systemic)
- [x] All P1 bugs resolved or explicitly deferred with documented reason
- [x] Each fix: mix test.changed passes, commit made
- [x] Each resolved bug updated with 'backlog fixed B_xxx --summary "..."'
- [x] Playwright scenario notes added to each bug's .todo file

## Protocol Per Bug
1. Read bug .todo file carefully
2. Reproduce locally (unit test preferred; browser if necessary)
3. Edit code — keep fix minimal and targeted
4. Run: mix test.changed
5. If tests pass: commit with 'fix: [area] [description]'
6. Run: backlog fixed B_xxx --summary '[one-line description of fix]'
7. Message team lead: 'Fixed B_xxx: [summary]'

## Notes
- Parallel-safe: bugs in different modules can be fixed by separate agents simultaneously
- If a fix causes test failures in unrelated tests, investigate before committing
- If a bug is not fixable in <30 min, escalate to team lead with a note

## Execution Notes (2026-02-21)
- P0 set (`B165`, `B169`) and P1 set (`B163`, `B164`, `B166`, `B167`, `B168`, `B170`) are resolved per triage report and bug statuses.
- Fixes were delivered in prior sprint commits (`499eaaa8`, `7e34c071`) and follow-up browser/validation verification.
- Bug records now carry scenario/verification notes for campaign traceability.
