## Purpose
Re-test fixed areas via browser and capture Playwright scenario stubs for regression tests.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Each fixed bug re-tested in browser — confirm resolution
- [x] Any regressions found filed as new bugs (backlog bug)
- [x] All fixed bugs have Playwright scenario section populated:
  - Test name (e.g., 'validation console sends message and receives response')
  - Preconditions (logged in, workspace exists, agent configured with model X)
  - Steps (navigate → type → send → wait → assert)
  - Assertions (response appears, session ID visible, no console errors)
- [x] docs/browser-testing/playwright-scenarios.md created with all scenario stubs

## Playwright Scenario Format
```
test('[test name]', async ({ page }) => {
  // Preconditions: [describe state]
  // Steps:
  //   1. await page.goto('/dashboard/validation-console')
  //   2. await page.click('[data-testid="new-session"]')
  //   3. await page.fill('[data-testid="message-input"]', 'Hello')
  //   4. await page.click('[data-testid="send-button"]')
  //   5. await expect(page.locator('.message.assistant')).toBeVisible()
});
```

## Notes
The Playwright scenarios don't need to be runnable yet — they're documentation for future test authoring. Focus on capturing the intent clearly.

## Execution Notes (2026-02-21)
- Re-verified browser behavior for recently fixed Skill Hub bugs:
  - `B171`: search miss now renders `No skills found.` without fetch error banner.
  - `B172`: detail interaction renders modal chrome/content (`boof`, action buttons) instead of blank payload render.
- Re-verified pair plugin route from `B174`: `/plugins/pair_programming/sessions/:session_id` now mounts Pair Session LiveView (no route error).
- Added/updated Playwright scenario notes in bug records missing structured sections (`B163`, `B165`, `B171`, `B172`, `B174`).
- Added consolidated scenario catalog at `docs/browser-testing/playwright-scenarios.md` for B163-B170, B171, B172, and B174.
- New regressions discovered during this pass were already captured as `B173` (UI flow missing) and `B174` (backend bootstrap path); no additional regressions were found in this verification loop.
- Verification coverage for prior fix-sprint bugs was documented explicitly in bug files:
  - `B164` plugin settings persistence.
  - `B166`/`B167` OpenAI-compat envelope + invalid-model validation.
  - `B168`/`B169` credentials vault 4xx handling (no 500 crash).
  - `B170` provider-hinted routing behavior.
