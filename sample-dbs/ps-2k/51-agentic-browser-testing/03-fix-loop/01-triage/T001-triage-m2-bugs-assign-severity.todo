## Purpose
After M2 testing campaigns are complete, review all filed bugs and prioritize.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All bugs from M2 campaigns reviewed (run: backlog list --bugs)
- [x] Each bug assigned severity: P0 (blocks core path), P1 (significant impairment), P2 (nice-to-fix), P3 (cosmetic)
- [x] Bugs grouped by feature area (validation-console, sessions, auth, plugins, tools, providers)
- [x] At least top 5 P0/P1 bugs identified for immediate fix sprint
- [x] Triage summary written to docs/browser-testing/triage-report.md

## Triage Criteria
- **P0 (critical)**: Core path broken — can't send messages, auth fails, crashes
- **P1 (high)**: Feature partially broken — some flows fail, data loss risk
- **P2 (medium)**: Degraded UX — wrong rendering, stale data, missing feedback
- **P3 (low)**: Cosmetic — styling, copy errors, minor layout issues

## Notes
Pre-alpha means many P2/P3 bugs are expected and OK to defer. Focus fix energy on P0/P1.

## Execution Notes (2026-02-21)
- Reviewed M2 campaign bug slice `B163`-`B170` and assigned severity bands.
- Grouped bugs into validation-console, plugin-settings, openai-compat/providers, and credentials-vault areas.
- Wrote triage summary and top P0/P1 shortlist in `docs/browser-testing/triage-report.md`.
