## Purpose
Team CLAUDE.md for the browser-testing session. Loaded by all agents in the team.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Defines the three roles: Team Lead, Explorer, Fix Agent
- [ ] Documents the browser handoff protocol (explicit 'You have the browser' message)
- [ ] Includes the bug report format template (Problem / Repro / Expected / Actual / Feature Area / Severity / Playwright Scenario sections)
- [ ] Feature coverage map table (area → key URLs → assigned explorer)
- [ ] Env vars and prerequisites (PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL, Chrome port, pag-server running)
- [ ] Quick-start: what the lead does on session start, what explorers do when idle

## Notes
Keep guidance directional, not scripted — explorers use judgment. The goal is enough structure for a fresh Claude session to pick up a role and contribute immediately.
