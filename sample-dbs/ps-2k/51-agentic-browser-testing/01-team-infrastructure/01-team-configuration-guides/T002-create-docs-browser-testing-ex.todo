## Purpose
Role guide for Explorer agents. Defines behavior, judgment rules, and protocol.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Role description: navigate PAG-Server UI, use judgment to find issues
- [ ] Wait protocol: do nothing until Team Lead sends 'You have the browser now'
- [ ] Bug filing instructions: use 'backlog bug' with full format template, then message lead with ID + one-liner summary
- [ ] Feature area assignment: which URLs/features each explorer covers
- [ ] When stuck: pause ≤5 min, try workaround, note in bug if stuck/blocked
- [ ] Done protocol: message lead 'Browser free', include list of all bug IDs filed and severity summary
- [ ] Navigation starting points: list of key URLs to begin from

## Scenario Progression Note
Document that exploration should start with the most visible/simple flows (navigation, page load, basic CRUD) before attempting complex multi-step operations (forks, multi-agent sessions, streaming edge cases).
