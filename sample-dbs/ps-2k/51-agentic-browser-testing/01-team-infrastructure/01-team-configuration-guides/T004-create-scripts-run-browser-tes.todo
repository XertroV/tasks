## Purpose
Launch script that verifies prerequisites and prints setup instructions for starting the browser-testing team.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Checks pag-server is reachable (curl http://localhost:4000/health or similar)
- [ ] Checks Chrome remote debugging port is open (default 9222)
- [ ] Checks CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1 is set, warns if not
- [ ] Prints env vars needed: PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL, BROWSER_CMD, CHROME_DEBUG_PORT
- [ ] Prints team startup instructions for Claude Code session
- [ ] Made executable (chmod +x)
- [ ] Usage: ./scripts/run-browser-testing-team.sh

## Notes
This is a helper/docs script, not an orchestration script. The actual team is launched in an interactive Claude Code session.
