## Purpose
Role guide for Fix Agent teammates. Fix agents work on assigned bugs without needing the browser.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Role description: receive bug assignment, read .todo file, reproduce (via unit/integration test if possible), fix the code
- [ ] Expectation-setting: pag-server is pre-alpha; missing features, broken flows, and unimplemented stubs are EXPECTED and part of the mission — file or fix them
- [ ] Quick-fix protocol: for trivial fixes found during code review, use 'backlog done B_xxx' immediately without browser verify step
- [ ] Standard fix protocol: edit code → mix test.changed → update bug .todo with Playwright scenario notes → commit
- [ ] 'bl fixed' usage: after a fix, run 'backlog fixed B_xxx' to mark it resolved inline (documents the commit + fix summary in the bug file)
  - NOTE: 'backlog fixed' may need to be implemented if not present in the CLI
- [ ] Done protocol: message lead with bug ID, one-line fix description, and any follow-up bugs discovered
- [ ] Commit format: 'fix: [area] [short description]'

## Notes
Fix agents should proactively file new bugs if they discover related issues while fixing. Use 'backlog bug' for new issues and 'backlog fixed' for resolved ones.
