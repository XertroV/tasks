## Purpose
Add a 'backlog fixed' subcommand (alias: 'bl fixed') that marks a bug as resolved inline during testing, recording the fix commit hash and a summary in the bug .todo file.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 'backlog fixed <BUG_ID>' marks the bug as done
- [ ] Optionally accepts '--commit <hash>' and '--summary <text>' flags
- [ ] If in a git repo, auto-captures the current HEAD commit hash
- [ ] Appends a 'Fixed in commit <hash>: <summary>' note to the bug .todo body
- [ ] Equivalent to 'backlog done' but with richer fix metadata
- [ ] Works from any directory (searches .tasks/bugs/)

## Implementation Notes
- Look at how 'backlog done' and 'backlog bug' are implemented for patterns
- The CLI is Python-based (check pyproject.toml or setup.py in the backlog tool source)
- If backlog is installed as a package, may need to fork or patch locally
- Alternative: implement as a shell wrapper in scripts/ that calls 'backlog done' + appends to the .todo file

## Acceptance Test
```bash
backlog bug --title "Test bug" --area validation-console
# -> creates B_001 or similar
backlog fixed B_001 --summary "Fixed by adding nil guard in validate_input"
backlog show B_001  # should show status: done + fix metadata
```
