**Primary task**: B224 - Unreplied GenServer requests on agent error/shutdown

**Instructions**:
This task was claimed as part of a multi-task batch. The primary agent (cli-user)

1. Use the Task tool with subagent_type to create a dedicated agent
2. Provide context from this task file as the prompt
3. Grant necessary tools for task completion
4. Monitor subagent progress
5. Aggregate results upon completion
