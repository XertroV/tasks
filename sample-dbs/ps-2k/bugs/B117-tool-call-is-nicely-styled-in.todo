TOOL_CALL is nicely styled in validation console, but TOOL_RESULT is not.

## Solution

Added styled display for tool_result and error in the validation console chat timeline:

1. **tool_result styling** (for completed tool calls with results):
   - Emerald/green color scheme (border-emerald-200, bg-emerald-50)
   - Shows "TOOL_RESULT" label with duration_ms
   - Formats result as JSON or truncated string

2. **error styling** (for failed tool calls):
   - Red color scheme (border-red-200, bg-red-50)
   - Shows "ERROR" label with error message

3. **Added helper function**: `format_tool_result/1` to format results nicely

## Files Modified
- `lib/pag_server_web/live/validation_console.html.heex` - Added result/error display
- `lib/pag_server_web/live/validation_console.ex` - Added format_tool_result/1 helper
