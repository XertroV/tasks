agent_server.ex:2311-2322 - Tool results persisted one-at-a-time in reduce; if persistence fails mid-batch, agent continues with inconsistent event log

## Delegation Instructions

**Delegated to subagent by**: cli-user (primary agent)
**Delegation date**: 2026-02-23 05:42 UTC
**Primary task**: B224 - Unreplied GenServer requests on agent error/shutdown

**Instructions**:
This task was claimed as part of a multi-task batch. The primary agent (cli-user)
should spawn a subagent to complete this task in parallel.

**Recommended approach**:
1. Use the Task tool with subagent_type to create a dedicated agent
2. Provide context from this task file as the prompt
3. Grant necessary tools for task completion
4. Monitor subagent progress
5. Aggregate results upon completion
