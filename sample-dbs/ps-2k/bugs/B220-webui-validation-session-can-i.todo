Browser-driven validation sessions can remain bound to a previous pair-programming child agent even after selecting a different workspace agent/model, causing prompts to generate text but not execute tools remotely.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- Reproduce from WebUI with clear steps\n- Either fix session binding/switching OR add explicit UI affordance to create/select fresh session tied to chosen agent\n- Add regression coverage for agent/session binding in validation console path\n- Document user-visible behavior

## Delegation Instructions

**Delegated to subagent by**: cli-user (primary agent)
**Delegation date**: 2026-02-22 06:21 UTC
**Primary task**: B219 - for web, /api/ should provide a description of all the API methods; should be self-describing in that way

**Instructions**:
This task was claimed as part of a multi-task batch. The primary agent (cli-user)
should spawn a subagent to complete this task in parallel.

**Recommended approach**:
1. Use the Task tool with subagent_type to create a dedicated agent
2. Provide context from this task file as the prompt
3. Grant necessary tools for task completion
4. Monitor subagent progress
5. Aggregate results upon completion

**Independence verification**:
- Different epic: ✓ (None vs None)
- No dependency chain: ✓ (verified at claim time)
