pag-connect Connection accepts mcp_tool_call arguments of any type; non-map payload can crash async call path and fail to emit mcp_tool_error. Validate arguments type and ensure safe_call catches exceptions/rescues.

## Delegation Instructions

**Delegated to subagent by**: cli-user (primary agent)
**Delegation date**: 2026-02-21 14:22 UTC
**Primary task**: B189 - Companion unregister should be PID-aware to avoid reconnect race

**Instructions**:
This task was claimed as part of a multi-task batch. The primary agent (cli-user)
should spawn a subagent to complete this task in parallel.

**Recommended approach**:
1. Use the Task tool with subagent_type to create a dedicated agent
2. Provide context from this task file as the prompt
3. Grant necessary tools for task completion
4. Monitor subagent progress
5. Aggregate results upon completion

**Independence verification**:
- Different epic: ✓ (None vs None)
- No dependency chain: ✓ (verified at claim time)
