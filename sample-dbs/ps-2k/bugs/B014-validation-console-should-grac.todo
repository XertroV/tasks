Validation Console currently loads dynamic provider models on mount and params without rescue. If DB/provider config query fails, the LiveView can fail to mount. Add fallback behavior so the page still loads with static catalog defaults, shows a non-blocking warning state, and allows core chat/settings flows to continue. Add tests for fallback path and failure-state UX.
