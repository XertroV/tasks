## Delegation Instructions

**Delegated to subagent by**: cli-user (primary agent)
**Delegation date**: 2026-02-15 16:16 UTC
**Primary task**: B003 - on thhe webui, when i try to send a prompt, it does nothing. even when connected to backend. it also says no active session selected, but i tried creating one with the new session button (also does nothing). no errors in console.

**Instructions**:
This task was claimed as part of a multi-task batch. The primary agent (cli-user)
should spawn a subagent to complete this task in parallel.

**Recommended approach**:
1. Use the Task tool with subagent_type to create a dedicated agent
2. Provide context from this task file as the prompt
3. Grant necessary tools for task completion
4. Monitor subagent progress
5. Aggregate results upon completion
