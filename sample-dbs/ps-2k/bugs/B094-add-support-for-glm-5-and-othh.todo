Add support for glm-5 and othher models from z.ai via their coding API


## Delegation Instructions

**Delegated to subagent by**: cli-user (primary agent)
**Delegation date**: 2026-02-17 12:06 UTC
**Primary task**: B084 - The validation console should show what tools are available to the agent (and have a debug interface for making tool calls)

**Instructions**:
This task was claimed as part of a multi-task batch. The primary agent (cli-user)
should spawn a subagent to complete this task in parallel.

**Recommended approach**:
1. Use the Task tool with subagent_type to create a dedicated agent
2. Provide context from this task file as the prompt
3. Grant necessary tools for task completion
4. Monitor subagent progress
5. Aggregate results upon completion

**Independence verification**:
- Different epic: ✓ (None vs None)
- No dependency chain: ✓ (verified at claim time)
