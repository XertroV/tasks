Add source field to model_info structs in ModelCatalog. Values: :static (only in static list), :live (only from discovery), :both (in both). This allows UI to show which models are verified live vs statically defined. Acceptance criteria: - source field present on all models returned by list_models/1 - Static-only models have source: :static - Live-only models have source: :live - Models in both have source: :both
