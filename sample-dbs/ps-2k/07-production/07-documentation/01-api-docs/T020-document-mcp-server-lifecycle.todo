# Document MCP server lifecycle and transport modules

Document MCP runtime lifecycle/transport APIs so callers can reason about process
states, startup/shutdown behavior, and protocol boundaries.


## Requirements

- [x] Add or improve `@doc` coverage in:
  - [x] `lib/pag_server/tools/mcp/server_lifecycle.ex`
  - [x] `lib/pag_server/tools/mcp/stdio_transport.ex`
  - [x] `lib/pag_server/tools/mcp/server.ex`
- [x] Add missing public `@spec` for lifecycle and transport entry points
- [x] Add `@typedoc` for exported config/state/result types
- [x] Document lifecycle transitions and failure modes at API boundaries
- [x] Run `mix docs` and fix warnings introduced by this task

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Scoped MCP modules have clear public `@doc` coverage
- [x] Public `@spec` coverage is complete for scoped MCP modules
- [x] Exported public types in scoped modules include `@typedoc`
- [x] `mix docs` completes without new warnings from scoped modules
