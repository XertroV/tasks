# Document events query and replay module APIs

Improve query/replay documentation so event-sourcing workflows are auditable and
easy to consume from higher-level orchestration code.


## Requirements

- [x] Add or improve `@doc/@spec` for public functions in:
  - [x] `lib/pag_server/events/queries.ex`
  - [x] `lib/pag_server/events/event_store.ex`
  - [x] `lib/pag_server/events/replay.ex`
- [x] Add `@typedoc` for exported query/replay result and filter types
- [x] Clarify ordering, pagination, and replay determinism expectations in docs
- [x] Ensure examples and terminology align with current event schema usage
- [x] Run `mix docs` and fix warnings introduced by this task

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Scoped events modules have public `@doc` coverage for exported functions
- [x] Public `@spec` coverage is complete for scoped events modules
- [x] Exported public types in scoped modules include `@typedoc`
- [x] `mix docs` completes without new warnings from scoped modules
