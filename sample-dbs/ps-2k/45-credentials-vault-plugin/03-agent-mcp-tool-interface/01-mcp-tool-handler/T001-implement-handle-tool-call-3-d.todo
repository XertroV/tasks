In CredentialsVault (the plugin module), implement handle_tool_call("credentials_vault", args, context). Extract and validate the 'action' field against the enum. Route to private handler functions. Return structured error for unknown actions including the list of valid actions (recovery aid). Extract agent_id, workspace_id, user_id from context. Actions: store, fetch, list, delete, rotate, history, help.
