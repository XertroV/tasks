Write one full end-to-end test: agent stores a secret via MCP tool, human retrieves metadata via REST, human reveals plaintext, agent rate-limit is enforced after burst, version history shows 2 entries after rotate, prune worker removes expired version. Also run mix lint and fix all Credo/Dialyzer warnings introduced by this plugin.
