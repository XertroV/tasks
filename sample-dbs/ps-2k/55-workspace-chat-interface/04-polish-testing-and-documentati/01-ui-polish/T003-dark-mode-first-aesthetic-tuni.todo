Tune the visual design following dark-mode-first, IDE-like aesthetic. Color-coded roles: indigo (user), neutral (assistant), amber (system), cyan (tools), violet (thinking). Add subtle pulsing cursor animation for streaming tokens (CSS @keyframes). Ensure light mode also works. Compact message bubbles, subtle borders, information-dense. Load frontend-design skill during implementation for quality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Dark mode looks polished and IDE-like
- Light mode functional
- Streaming cursor animation visible
- Color coding consistent across roles
- No generic AI-generated UI feel
