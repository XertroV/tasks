# Standardize Connector Messaging plugin MCP interface

## Scope

- Audit `plugins/connector_messaging/lib/connector_plugin.ex`.
- Plan conversion from:
  - `list_connectors`
  - `send_connector_message`
- to a single plugin domain tool with `action` or `subcommand` dispatch.
- Keep compatibility strategy explicit (if this includes existing LLM workflows).

## Requirements

- Define a single MCP tool shape and schema with an operation enum.
- Add per-operation required argument docs and usage examples.
- Require and validate context-driven workspace scoping in the dispatcher path.
- Specify deterministic failure payloads for unknown operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] New schema documents a single dispatch argument with at least:
  - `list_connectors`
  - `send_connector_message`
- [ ] Unknown operations return a structured error with known operations listed.
- [ ] Response includes selected operation field for observability.
- [ ] All current existing operations retain behavior parity in design notes.
- [ ] Compatibility/migration note is documented before implementation work begins.
