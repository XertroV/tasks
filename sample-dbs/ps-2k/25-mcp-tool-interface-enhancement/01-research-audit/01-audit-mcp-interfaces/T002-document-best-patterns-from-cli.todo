# Document best patterns from each CLI tool interface audit

Synthesize the findings from T001 into a canonical "best of breed" spec for each
tool type. Identify which CLI has the best argument shape, description quality, and
UX for each tool category. Combine the best elements into a recommended design for
pag-server's MCP tool suite.

## Requirements

- For each tool category (bash/exec, read, write, edit, glob, list, spawn-agent):
  - Identify the strongest argument design from the audited CLIs
  - Identify the strongest tool description and parameter descriptions
  - Note any UX patterns worth adopting (e.g. `old_string`/`new_string` diff style,
    line-number-aware reads, recursive glob, subagent size/model hints)
- Produce a design document: `docs/mcp-tool-interface-design.md`
- Flag any gaps or improvements not yet seen in any existing CLI

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Design document created at docs/mcp-tool-interface-design.md (or equivalent)
- [ ] Each tool type has a recommended argument schema with rationale
- [ ] Descriptions are precise, concise, and actionable for LLM consumers
- [ ] Document is reviewed and ready to drive M2 implementation
- [ ] Any novel improvements beyond existing CLIs are clearly marked
