# Run integration tests one-by-one with Groq backend



## Requirements

- Configure Groq as the LLM backend for integration tests
- Run each integration test individually to isolate failures
- Fix issues that arise during testing
- Track iteration count (max 6 iterations)
- If more than 6 iterations are needed, mark task as blocked and document findings

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All integration tests pass when run one-by-one with Groq backend
- [ ] Any discovered issues are fixed (within 6 iteration limit)
- [ ] Test results documented (which tests pass/fail with Groq)
- [ ] If blocked after 6 iterations: task marked as blocked with clear documentation of remaining issues
- [ ] Configuration changes for Groq backend are properly implemented

## Implementation Notes

Run tests individually with Groq configured as the provider:
```bash
# Configure Groq provider in test config
# Run each test file individually:
mix test test/integration/some_test.exs --max-cases 1
```

Track iterations - if any single test requires more than 6 fix attempts, mark task as blocked and continue with other work.
