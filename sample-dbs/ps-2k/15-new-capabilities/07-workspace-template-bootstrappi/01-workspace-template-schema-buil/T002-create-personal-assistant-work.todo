## Description
Create a full workspace template YAML file for a Personal Assistant use case. This is the flagship template demonstrating the conversational bootstrap pattern.

## Bootstrap Prompt
Detailed system prompt instructing the agent to conduct onboarding conversation. The agent should:
- Introduce itself warmly and explain the setup process
- Work through questionnaire sections one at a time
- Ask follow-up questions based on answers
- Confirm answers before moving on
- Generate workspace files from collected answers
- Signal completion when done

## Questionnaire Sections
1. **Identity & Naming**: What should I call you? What name do you want for me? What vibe/personality should I have?
2. **Communication Style**: Formal or casual? Emoji usage? Verbosity preference? Humor level?
3. **About You (USER.md)**: Your name, timezone, pronouns, what you do, current projects/interests
4. **Daily Life & Routines**: Morning routine, work schedule, common tasks you need help with
5. **Privacy & Boundaries**: What topics are off-limits? What should never be shared externally? Comfort level with proactive suggestions?
6. **Tools & Environment**: What platforms do you use? Preferred apps? Smart home devices?
7. **Memory Preferences**: What should I remember? How often should I summarize? Daily log preferences?

## Default Files (with {{variable}} substitution)
- SOUL.md - Personality, tone, values, boundaries (populated from sections 2, 5)
- IDENTITY.md - Agent name, vibe, emoji, avatar (from section 1)
- USER.md - Human profile (from section 3)
- MEMORY.md - Empty template with structure
- TOOLS.md - Environment notes (from section 6)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] personal-assistant.yml in priv/workspace_templates/
- [ ] Bootstrap prompt is detailed enough to conduct full conversation
- [ ] All questionnaire sections defined with question types and expected formats
- [ ] Default files use {{variable}} substitution from questionnaire answers
- [ ] Template loads and validates via WorkspaceTemplate schema
- [ ] Template variables match questionnaire answer keys
