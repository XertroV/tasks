Redesign initial persona selection to show topic interests rather than persona names.

## Features
- Display big list of topics/interests (ways bot can help):
  * Email management
  * Tech lead / Code reviews
  * Product development & Startup/VC raising
  * Technical offsider (code, devops, etc)
  * Social media advisor/mentor
  * ...and more

- Toggle buttons for topics (press to select/deselect)
- Free-text input for custom interests
  * User types: 'help me with my maths homework'
  * User types: 'help me track my goals and projects'
  * These become toggle-able options

- Map selected topics to appropriate personas
- Support multiple topic selection
- Create custom persona from combined interests
