# Document provider configuration, fallback semantics, and troubleshooting



## Requirements

- Document all supported provider configuration keys, credential requirements, and enable/disable flags.
- Document fallback, randomization, cooldown semantics, and operational troubleshooting guidance.
- Add a dedicated section: "How to onboard another tool to the multi-provider orchestration pattern" with concrete implementation steps.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Documentation includes setup examples for DuckDuckGo, Brave, ZAI, and external provider options.
- Troubleshooting section covers rate limits, credential errors, provider disablement, and cooldown behavior.
- Onboarding section includes a reusable checklist covering facade contract, provider behaviour, orchestrator wiring, tests, telemetry, and docs updates.
