# Add provider adapter tests with mocked HTTP and malformed payload coverage



## Requirements

- Add adapter tests for Brave, ZAI, and DuckDuckGo with mocked HTTP responses.
- Cover malformed payload, timeout, and rate-limit/error-body handling for each adapter.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Adapter tests verify normalization of happy-path payloads across providers.
- Failure-mode tests assert provider-specific responses are mapped to shared error taxonomy.
