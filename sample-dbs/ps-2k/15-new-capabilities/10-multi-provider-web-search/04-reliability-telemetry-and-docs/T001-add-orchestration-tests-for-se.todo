# Add orchestration tests for selection, failover, and cooldown behavior



## Requirements

- Add focused tests for provider selection, fallback behavior, and cooldown exclusion.
- Keep tests fast and deterministic by injecting RNG/time functions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Test suite validates healthy-provider randomization and fallback on provider failures.
- Cooldown expiry and re-entry behavior are covered without sleep-based test delays.
