# Extract DuckDuckGo logic into adapter and keep as no-key fallback



## Requirements

- Move existing DuckDuckGo request/parsing logic into a dedicated provider adapter module.
- Preserve current DuckDuckGo behavior as baseline no-key fallback provider.

## Acceptance Criteria

- DuckDuckGo adapter implements provider behaviour and passes existing parser tests.
- `web_search` continues to work with no additional provider keys configured.
