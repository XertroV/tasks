# Implement CLI provider adapter with strict timeout and output normalization



## Requirements

- Implement CLI-based provider adapter to execute external search CLIs with strict timeout and argument validation.
- Normalize CLI output into shared result schema and map non-zero exit states to provider errors.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Adapter successfully parses expected JSON/text output into normalized result entries.
- Timeout, malformed output, and command failure paths are covered by automated tests.
