# Document 10-minute onboarding runbook and operator checklist

## Owner Outcome
- I can follow one runbook to start server, create main agent, connect Telegram, and chat in under 10 minutes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Add end-to-end setup runbook in docs covering prerequisites, commands, and screenshots/expected outputs.
  - `docs/guides/workspace-onboarding.md` enhanced with verification table, expected HTTP responses, both UI and API paths documented.
- [x] Include troubleshooting matrix for template issues, workspace readiness gaps, and Telegram failures.
  - Three subsection tables: template issues (404/invalid category/model), workspace readiness gaps, Telegram failures (token/webhook/SSL).
- [x] Add operator checklist that maps directly to onboarding checklist states in LiveView.
  - 6-item checklist mapping to `WorkspaceState.checklist_state/1` flags.
- [x] Document rollback/reset steps to retry setup from a clean state.
  - Four procedures: delete workspace, reset Telegram only, re-bootstrap, reset wizard step.
- [x] Explicitly state and validate the target outcome: "start server, create main agent, connect Telegram, and chat in <10 minutes."
  - Time budget table with running totals and explicit <10 minute validation.
