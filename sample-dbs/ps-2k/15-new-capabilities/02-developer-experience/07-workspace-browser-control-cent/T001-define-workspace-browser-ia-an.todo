## Goal
Define the information architecture for a workspace browser that supports fast navigation plus safe configuration editing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Workspace list, detail pane, and edit affordances are mapped to concrete backend endpoints.
- Workspace membership and RBAC constraints are documented for each UI action.
- A clear distinction exists between global settings and workspace-scoped settings.
- Includes a sketch of creative UX hooks (status chips, health badges, quick actions).

## Sibling Batch Instructions

**Batch mode**: siblings (same epic: P15.M2.E7)
**Agent**: cli-user
**Date**: 2026-02-18 04:06 UTC
**Sibling tasks**: P15.M2.E7.T002, P15.M2.E7.T003, P15.M2.E7.T004, P15.M2.E7.T005, P15.M2.E7.T006

**Instructions**:
This task is part of a sibling batch from the same epic.
Spawn ONE subagent to implement ALL sibling tasks sequentially.
Work through tasks in order: P15.M2.E7.T001 → P15.M2.E7.T002 → P15.M2.E7.T003 → P15.M2.E7.T004 → P15.M2.E7.T005 → P15.M2.E7.T006
Mark each done individually after completion.
