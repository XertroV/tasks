# Build sessions and agents browser with filtering and grouping



## Requirements

- Implement a browser panel listing sessions and agents with clear grouping and compact metadata.
- Support filtering by status/name and sorting by recent activity for rapid debugging workflows.
- Add selection behavior so choosing a session/agent updates the active chat context.
- Handle empty and loading states cleanly when no sessions or agents exist yet.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Sessions and agents load from backend APIs and render with stable identifiers.
- Filter/search interactions update the visible list without full page reloads.
- Selecting a session/agent updates the active context and drives downstream chat behavior.
- Empty, loading, and failed-fetch states are all represented with user-readable feedback.

## Implementation Notes

- Browser pane loads recent sessions and agents directly from schema-backed queries.
- Filtering implemented as LiveView `phx-change` with:
  - text query (`id/name/project`)
  - status filter (`all/active/idle/paused/failed`)
- Grouping implemented as:
  - sessions grouped by `session.status`
  - agents grouped by `agent.project` (`unscoped` fallback)
- Selection wiring:
  - selecting session sets active session+agent and reloads transcript
  - selecting agent sets active agent and switches to first session for that agent if available
- Empty states explicitly rendered when no sessions/agents are available.
