# Scaffold Phoenix LiveView console shell with responsive layout



## Requirements

- Create a dedicated LiveView route/module for the validation console inside the existing Phoenix app.
- Implement a responsive shell layout with panels for left navigation (sessions/agents), center chat, and right utility/settings.
- Add baseline client-side hooks needed for streaming updates and interactive tool actions.
- Keep implementation lightweight and local-first, reusing existing app styles/components where practical.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The console route renders successfully on desktop and mobile breakpoints without layout breakage.
- Core shell regions are present with stable IDs/classes for future task wiring.
- LiveView mounts cleanly with no console errors and supports hot reload in local dev.
- A simple empty-state layout is visible before any session/chat data loads.

## Implementation Notes

- Added `PagServerWeb.Live.ValidationConsole` + `validation_console.html.heex`.
- Added route: `live "/validation-console", ValidationConsole` under `/dashboard` scope.
- Added nav link in `layouts/app.html.heex`.
- Shell regions with stable IDs:
  - `validation-console-shell`
  - `vc-browser-pane`
  - `vc-chat-pane`
  - `vc-utility-pane`
- Responsive behavior implemented with `xl:grid-cols-12` split (3/6/3) and stacked mobile layout.
- Empty states implemented for sessions, agents, and transcript.
