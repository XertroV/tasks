# Document local usage workflows for quick validation sessions



## Requirements

- Document setup and day-to-day usage for the validation console in local development.
- Include focused workflows: quick smoke validation, tool invocation testing, and session fork debugging.
- Add troubleshooting notes for common issues (missing providers, stale session selection, stream disconnects).
- Cross-link relevant backend API docs and task IDs for maintainers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A developer can follow docs to launch the console and complete a basic validation session.
- Documentation includes at least three concrete workflow recipes tied to console UI actions.
- Troubleshooting section covers common failure modes with practical fixes.
- Docs are linked from an obvious project location for discoverability.

## Implementation Notes (2026-02-15)

- Added `docs/guides/validation-console.md` covering setup, smoke loop usage, tool invocation checks, and fork-debug workflow.
- Included troubleshooting guidance for provider/model issues, stale session selection, and stream interruption handling.
- Documented fast local commands (`mix test ...validation_console_test.exs`, `scripts/validation_console_smoke.sh`).
- Linked the new guide from `README.md` in the documentation references section for discoverability.
