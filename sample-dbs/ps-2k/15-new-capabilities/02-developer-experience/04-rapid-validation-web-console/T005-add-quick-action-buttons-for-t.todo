# Add quick action buttons for tool invocation and test presets



## Requirements

- Add a quick-actions area with one-click buttons for frequent testing flows (run tool loop, replay latest, seed prompt presets).
- Ensure each action is wired to explicit backend operations and surfaces progress/result feedback.
- Provide guardrails so destructive or unsupported actions are hidden/disabled.
- Keep presets configurable from code constants to simplify maintenance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- At least three useful quick actions are implemented and executable from the UI.
- Triggering an action shows pending, success, and error feedback in context.
- Action handlers use backend APIs/channels documented in T001 without ad hoc contracts.
- Disabled/unsupported actions are visibly non-interactive with explanatory text.

## Implementation Notes

- Quick-actions panel includes:
  - `Scan tool registry` -> `PagServer.Tools.Registry.list_schemas/0`
  - `Fork active session` -> `PagServer.Sessions.Session.fork/2`
  - `Replay latest prompt` -> pulls latest user message and replays send flow
  - prompt preset loaders (`Smoke prompt`, `Tool loop`, `Error drill`)
- Contextual feedback states implemented as `pending`, `ok`, `error` banners (`action_feedback`).
- Actions requiring active session are disabled when no session is selected.
- Presets are maintained in LiveView module constants (`@quick_presets`) for easy edits.
