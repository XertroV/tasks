# Add lightweight event timeline for messages and tool activity



## Requirements

- Add a compact event timeline that logs message lifecycle markers and tool activity for the active session.
- Include event timestamp, type, and short payload summary with newest-first ordering.
- Support incremental updates while a run is active, reusing existing event sources where possible.
- Provide filters to show/hide noisy event categories for faster debugging.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Timeline renders core event types (message sent, stream started/ended, tool started/ended, error).
- New events appear in near real time without manual refresh.
- Event filters work client-side and do not affect chat/session correctness.
- Timeline remains readable under moderate event volume (no obvious duplicate flooding).

## Implementation Notes (2026-02-15)

- Added a lightweight **Event Timeline** panel to the validation console utility pane with newest-first ordering.
- Implemented timeline event modeling via `PagServerWeb.Live.ValidationConsoleTimeline` for persisted message/tool events plus runtime stream/control/error events.
- Added category filters (`message`, `stream`, `tool`, `control`, `error`) handled in LiveView without mutating session/chat state.
- Added incremental runtime event insertion for stream start/end/stop and control outcomes so timeline updates immediately during active workflows.
- Added compact event rendering with timestamp, event type badge, and payload summary for quick debugging scans.
