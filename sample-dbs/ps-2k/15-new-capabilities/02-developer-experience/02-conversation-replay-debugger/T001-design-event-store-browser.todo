# Design event store browser

## Description
Create a browsable interface for the event store that allows developers to explore events by session, agent, event type, and time range. Support filtering and search for debugging conversations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create `PagServerWeb.Live.EventBrowser` LiveView module
- [ ] Add route `/dashboard/events` in router.ex
- [ ] Implement event list with pagination
- [ ] Add filters: session_id, agent_id, event_type, time_range
- [ ] Show event payload preview in list view
- [ ] Add full event detail modal/view
- [ ] Support event type color coding
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Lint passes

## Context
- Related files: `lib/pag_server/events/queries.ex`, `lib/pag_server/events/event_store.ex`, `lib/pag_server/schema/event.ex`
- Part of epic: Conversation Replay Debugger
- Use existing Events.Queries for data access


## Delegation Instructions

**Delegated to subagent by**: cli-user (primary agent)
**Delegation date**: 2026-02-13 10:51 UTC
**Primary task**: P13.M1.E2.T001 - Create AgentServer.StreamProcessor module

**Instructions**:
This task was claimed as part of a multi-task batch. The primary agent (cli-user)
should spawn a subagent to complete this task in parallel.

**Recommended approach**:
1. Use the Task tool with subagent_type to create a dedicated agent
2. Provide context from this task file as the prompt
3. Grant necessary tools for task completion
4. Monitor subagent progress
5. Aggregate results upon completion

**Independence verification**:
- Different epic: ✓ (P15.M2.E2 vs P13.M1.E2)
- No dependency chain: ✓ (verified at claim time)


## Sibling Batch Instructions

**Batch mode**: siblings (same epic: P15.M2.E2)
**Agent**: cli-user
**Date**: 2026-02-14 00:24 UTC
**Sibling tasks**: P15.M2.E2.T002, P15.M2.E2.T003

**Instructions**:
This task is part of a sibling batch from the same epic.
Spawn ONE subagent to implement ALL sibling tasks sequentially.
Work through tasks in order: P15.M2.E2.T001 → P15.M2.E2.T002 → P15.M2.E2.T003
Mark each done individually after completion.
