# Implement step-through debugging

## Description
Build a step-through debugger that allows replaying events one at a time, showing state changes at each step. Enable developers to understand how agent state evolved during a conversation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create `PagServer.Events.Stepper` module for sequential event replay
- [ ] Implement step forward/backward navigation
- [ ] Show state snapshot at each event step
- [ ] Highlight what changed between steps
- [ ] Add "run to event" functionality (jump to specific event)
- [ ] Display tool calls and their results at each step
- [ ] Support breakpoint-like markers on event types
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Lint passes

- Part of epic: Conversation Replay Debugger
- Build on existing Events.Replay infrastructure
