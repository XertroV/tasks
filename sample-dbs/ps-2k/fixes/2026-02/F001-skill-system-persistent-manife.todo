Implemented four skill system features:
- InstallManifest: JSON lockfile at .skills/.manifest.json (survives page refresh)
- ContextBuilder: injects installed skills into agent system prompts
- install_from_path/3: local dir install for dev/testing without ClawHub
- uninstall_skill/3: removes skill dir, updates manifest, emits audit event

REST endpoints: POST /api/v1/skills/local/install, DELETE /api/v1/skills/clawhub/:slug
LiveView: uninstall_skill event handler, handle_params loads manifest for installed_slugs
