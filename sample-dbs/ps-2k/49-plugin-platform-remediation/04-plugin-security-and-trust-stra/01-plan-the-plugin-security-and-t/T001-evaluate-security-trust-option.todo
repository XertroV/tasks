# Security/Trust Planning Task

Reference documents:
- docs/plans/2026-02-20-plugin-platform-remediation-plan.md
- docs/plans/2026-02-20-plugin-security-model.md
- .tasks/ideas/I058-plugin-security-and-trust-hard.todo

Scope:
- Compare candidate trust models for plugin provenance/integrity, permission enforcement, policy controls, and operational safeguards.
- Confirm ordered implementation: Option B baseline before Option C hardening.
- Define Option C around Sigstore/Cosign with a flexible endpoint model and local-only fallback compatibility.

Deliverables:
- Decision memo with chosen approach and alternatives rejected.
- Updated backlog follow-up tasks for approved direction.

Acceptance criteria:
- Proposal references Idea I058 and planning doc.
- Proposal includes explicit risks, assumptions, and migration implications.
- Team review confirms direction before any security implementation work starts.
