# Decide and document static versus runtime plugin route model



## Requirements

- Evaluate static compile-time routes versus runtime plugin route registration for current architecture and constraints.
- Produce a documented decision (ADR-style) with implications for plugin authors and runtime behavior.
- Update plugin author docs to reflect the selected route model and constraints.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A clear decision document exists with rationale and trade-offs.
- Router/plugin docs align with the selected model.
- Tests or validations cover the expected route behavior under the selected model.
