# Build plugin doctor validation command and API diagnostics



## Requirements

- Implement a `plugin doctor` workflow (CLI and/or API) for manifest, compatibility, and lifecycle preflight checks.
- Return structured diagnostics suitable for CLI output and future editor/CI integrations.
- Cover common plugin authoring mistakes with explicit remediation hints.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Plugin doctor reports deterministic pass/fail results with machine-readable diagnostics.
- Core checks include manifest validation, compatibility checks, and lifecycle preflight.
- Tests cover successful validation and representative failure scenarios.
