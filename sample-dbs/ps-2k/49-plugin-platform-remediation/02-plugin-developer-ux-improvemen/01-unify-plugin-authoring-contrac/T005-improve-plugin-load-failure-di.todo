# Improve plugin load failure diagnostics and lifecycle traceability



## Requirements

- Improve plugin startup/load diagnostics to clearly report loaded, skipped, and failed plugins with reasons.
- Add lifecycle traceability signals (events/log metadata) for enable/disable/load transitions.
- Ensure failure diagnostics are actionable for plugin authors and operators.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Plugin load failures include explicit plugin id, phase, and error reason.
- Lifecycle transitions emit consistent traceable metadata.
- Tests verify diagnostic payload shape and key failure-mode outputs.
