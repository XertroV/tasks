# Add compatibility gates for install and update operations



## Requirements

- Add compatibility gates for install/update using host/plugin version and feature constraints.
- Fail early with structured compatibility diagnostics before mutating runtime state.
- Add tests covering compatible and incompatible plugin versions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Install/update operations reject incompatible plugins before runtime changes.
- Compatibility error messages include failing constraints and remediation hints.
- Tests validate both accepted and rejected compatibility scenarios.
