# Define update lifecycle semantics with preflight health checks and rollback



## Requirements

- Define first-class plugin update lifecycle with preflight validation, staged apply, post-update health checks, and rollback.
- Implement update orchestration so plugin `update` is distinct from simple config mutation.
- Add tests for successful update and rollback-on-health-check-failure.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Update lifecycle API exists with explicit pre, apply, verify, and rollback semantics.
- Failed post-update validation triggers rollback to prior stable state.
- Tests prove deterministic behavior across success and failure update paths.
