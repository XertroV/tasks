# Add failure recovery policies cooldown retry and operator-visible outcomes



## Requirements

- Define and implement plugin failure recovery policies (retry, cooldown, and disable/quarantine thresholds).
- Surface operator-visible outcomes for repeated plugin failures.
- Add tests for retry and cooldown behavior to prevent failure thrashing.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Repeated plugin failures trigger deterministic recovery policy behavior.
- Recovery outcomes are visible via logs/events for operators.
- Tests verify cooldown/retry policy transitions and resulting plugin states.
