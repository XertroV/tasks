# Implement explicit reload operation for BEAM and external MCP plugins



## Requirements

- Implement explicit plugin reload operation semantics for BEAM and external/MCP plugin classes.
- Ensure reload runs through lifecycle controls with predictable state teardown/startup behavior.
- Add tests for successful reload and reload failure handling per plugin class.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Reload operation is exposed via plugin lifecycle APIs with clear contracts.
- Reload behavior is deterministic for both BEAM and external plugin types.
- Tests validate successful reload and safe failure paths.
