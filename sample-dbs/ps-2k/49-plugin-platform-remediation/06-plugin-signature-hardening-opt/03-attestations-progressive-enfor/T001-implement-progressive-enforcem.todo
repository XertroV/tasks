# Implement progressive enforcement modes and break-glass exceptions



## Requirements

- Implement progressive trust enforcement modes from warn to strict enforcement.
- Support break-glass exceptions with explicit reason, TTL, and audit trail.
- Ensure enforcement mode transitions are safe and reversible.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Enforcement modes can be configured and applied without code changes.
- Break-glass usage is explicit, time-bounded, and auditable.
- Tests cover mode transitions and emergency override behavior.
