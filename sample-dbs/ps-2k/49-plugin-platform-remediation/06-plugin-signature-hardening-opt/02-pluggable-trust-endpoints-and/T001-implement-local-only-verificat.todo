# Implement local-only verification mode with managed trust roots



## Requirements

- Implement local-only signature verification mode with managed trust roots and no mandatory external network dependency.
- Support importing and rotating trust roots in local deployments.
- Ensure local-only mode remains compatible with policy and audit contracts.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Signature verification can run with local trust roots only.
- Trust-root import and rotation flows are documented and test-covered.
- Decision outputs and audit events match online verification mode shape.
