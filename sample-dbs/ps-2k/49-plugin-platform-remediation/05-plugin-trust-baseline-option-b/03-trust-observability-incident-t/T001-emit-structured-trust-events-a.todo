# Emit structured trust events and wire telemetry handlers



## Requirements

- Emit structured trust events for install, verify, enable, execute, update, quarantine, and remove operations.
- Wire plugin trust telemetry into centralized observability handlers.
- Include correlation fields for actor, workspace, session, plugin version, and decision reason.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Trust event schema is consistent and documented.
- Central telemetry handlers receive and process trust events.
- Tests validate event payload shape and coverage across core trust transitions.
