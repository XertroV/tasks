# Add plugin provenance persistence model and migrations



## Requirements

- Add persistence model for plugin provenance including source URI, publisher identity, artifact digest, and verifier backend.
- Capture provenance on install and update operations.
- Ensure provenance records are queryable for incident reconstruction.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Schema migration and data model are implemented and documented.
- Install/update flows persist provenance records transactionally.
- Tests cover provenance writes and reads for success and failure paths.
