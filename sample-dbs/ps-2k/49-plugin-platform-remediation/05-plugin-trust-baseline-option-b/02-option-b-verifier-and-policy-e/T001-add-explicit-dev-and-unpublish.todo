# Add explicit dev and unpublished override flow with TTL and audit



## Requirements

- Add explicit override flow for local dev and unpublished plugins requiring reason and optional TTL.
- Scope overrides to workspace or global policy with clear precedence.
- Emit audit events for override creation, use, expiry, and revocation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Unpublished plugin installs are denied unless an explicit override rule applies.
- Overrides can expire automatically and no longer grant trust after expiry.
- Audit logs include actor, scope, reason, and expiration data.
