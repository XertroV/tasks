# Implement checksum verification in plugin install and update pipeline



## Requirements

- Verify artifact checksums in install and update pipelines before unpack/load.
- Persist checksum verification outcomes in provenance records.
- Surface explicit mismatch diagnostics and fail safely.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Tampered artifacts with checksum mismatch are rejected.
- Successful checksum verification is persisted and traceable.
- Tests cover valid checksum, mismatch, and missing checksum policy paths.
