# Align manifest hook validation with lifecycle dispatcher



## Requirements

- Align manifest hook validation with lifecycle hook dispatch mappings so declared supported hooks are accepted consistently.
- Reject unknown hooks with structured errors listing supported hook names.
- Update docs/examples to match the canonical supported hook set.

## Acceptance Criteria

- All hooks supported by lifecycle dispatch are accepted by manifest validation.
- Unknown hooks produce deterministic, actionable validation errors.
- Tests cover accepted hook names, rejected names, and docs/examples stay in sync.
