Load the review-and-fix skill. Review all epics and tasks under P23.M1 (Exec Approval System). Check: overall code quality, feature completeness, integration with the rest of the codebase, and pattern reuse / code duplication. This is safety-critical code. Key areas: CommandClassifier (dangerous-pattern matching accuracy, false positive/negative rate), ApprovalManager GenServer (race conditions, timeout handling), Phoenix channel integration (approval_required/approve/deny events, broadcast ordering), workspace config fields, REST API for listing/resolving approvals, and E2E integration tests.
