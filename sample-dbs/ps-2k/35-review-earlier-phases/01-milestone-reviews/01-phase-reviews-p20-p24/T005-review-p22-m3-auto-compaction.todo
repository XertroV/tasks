Load the review-and-fix skill. Review all epics and tasks under P22.M3 (Auto-Compaction). Check: overall code quality, feature completeness, integration with the rest of the codebase, and pattern reuse / code duplication. Key areas: CompactionMonitor GenServer (threshold detection, trigger logic), integration with existing context summarization, session-level compaction config fields, proactive compaction replacing old summaries, compaction status tracking schema, and GET/POST API endpoints for compaction status/trigger.
