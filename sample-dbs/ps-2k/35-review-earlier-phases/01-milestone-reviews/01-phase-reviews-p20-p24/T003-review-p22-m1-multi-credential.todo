Load the review-and-fix skill. Review all epics and tasks under P22.M1 (Multi-Credential Provider Auth). Check: overall code quality, feature completeness, integration with the rest of the codebase, and pattern reuse / code duplication. Key areas: llm_provider_credentials schema/migration, CredentialSelector (ordered selection, cooldown tracking), credential rotation in the LLM client hot path, differentiated cooldown for rate-limit vs error, CRUD API endpoints, and tests. Pay special attention to correctness under concurrent load and cooldown state consistency.
