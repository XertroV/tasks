Load the review-and-fix skill. Review all epics and tasks under P24.M1 (Cross-Workspace Communication Plugin). Check: overall code quality, feature completeness, integration with the rest of the codebase, and pattern reuse / code duplication. Key areas: session_mailbox and mailbox_message Ecto schemas/migrations, MessageRouter GenServer (delivery correctness, broadcast/scope/DM logic), MCP tools (send_message, list_messages, mark_read, subscribe_to_topic), CrossWorkspacePlugin module with workspace discovery, and wake-on-message hook into session activation.
