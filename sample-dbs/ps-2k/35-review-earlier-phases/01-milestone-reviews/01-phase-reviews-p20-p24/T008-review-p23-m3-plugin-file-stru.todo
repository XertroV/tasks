Load the review-and-fix skill. Review all epics and tasks under P23.M3 (Plugin File Structure Refactor). Check: overall code quality, feature completeness, integration with the rest of the codebase, and pattern reuse / code duplication. Key areas: top-level plugins/ directory structure, PluginLoader discovery update, migration of all plugins from lib/pag_server/plugins/ to plugins/, mix.exs compile path changes, removal of old lib/pag_server/plugins/, and that the full test suite passes after the refactor. Check for any leftover references to old paths.
