Load the review-and-fix skill. Review all epics and tasks under P20.M1 (Plugin Schema Infrastructure). Check: overall code quality, feature completeness, integration with the rest of the codebase, and pattern reuse / code duplication. Relevant directories: .tasks/20-plugin-database-schemas/01-plugin-schema-infrastructure/, lib/pag_server/plugins/ (schema migrator, validator, KV store). Also verify that the migration framework is correctly wired into plugin startup and that CryptoId was migrated cleanly.
