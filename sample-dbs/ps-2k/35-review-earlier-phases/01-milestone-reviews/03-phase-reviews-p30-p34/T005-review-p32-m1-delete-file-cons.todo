Load the review-and-fix skill. Review all epics and tasks under P32.M1 (Delete File Consensus). Check: overall code quality, feature completeness, integration with the rest of the codebase, and pattern reuse / code duplication. This is a novel concurrency pattern — review with extra care. Key areas: ConsensusVote Ecto schema/migration, ConsensusManager GenServer (quorum tracking, timeout/expiry, vote collection), VoteForker (forks ephemeral agents via SessionForker, injects interruption message, parses VOTE YES/NO from response), file_delete tool integration, workspace quorum config, MCP tool for listing/responding to votes, cleanup of forked agents, and integration tests. Check for race conditions, quorum math correctness, and edge cases (all agents abstain, tie-breaking, timeout).
