Load the review-and-fix skill. Review all epics and tasks under P34.M3 (WebUI Skill Browser). Check: overall code quality, feature completeness, integration with the rest of the codebase, and pattern reuse / code duplication. Key areas: skill_hub_live.ex LiveView component (search UX, browse/filter, skill detail view, install flow), integration with P34.M1 registry client and P34.M2 parser, skill installation to workspaces, and any associated tests. Note: tasks were pending at time of phase creation — verify implementation exists and is complete.
