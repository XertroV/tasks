Load the review-and-fix skill. Review all epics and tasks under P34.M1 (ClawHub Registry Integration). Check: overall code quality, feature completeness, integration with the rest of the codebase, and pattern reuse / code duplication. Key areas: ClawHub HTTP client module (search, list, download, error handling, rate limiting), integration with PluginMarketplace context, registry_manager and registry_behaviour modules, and tests. Note: tasks were pending at time of phase creation — verify implementation exists and is complete.
