Load the review-and-fix skill. Review all epics and tasks under P34.M2 (Skill Format Parser). Check: overall code quality, feature completeness, integration with the rest of the codebase, and pattern reuse / code duplication. Key areas: SKILL.md YAML frontmatter parser (correctness, edge cases), metadata extraction (name, description, requirements, tags), skill validation logic, and integration with the ClawHub client from P34.M1. Note: tasks were pending at time of phase creation — verify implementation exists and is complete.
