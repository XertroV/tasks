Load the review-and-fix skill. Review all epics and tasks under P33.M1 (Pag Mascot System). Check: overall code quality, feature completeness, integration with the rest of the codebase, and pattern reuse / code duplication. Key areas: pag-sprite.svg (character design, animation frames), PagLiveComponent (LiveView event handling, assigns structure), CSS animation system (mood states, movement, transitions), tamagotchi mechanics (mood/energy/hunger state machine, decay logic), user interaction handlers (click, hover, feed), dashboard integration (layout, z-index, responsive behaviour), and state persistence (localStorage or server assigns).
