Load the review-and-fix skill. Review all epics and tasks under P25.M3 (MCP Tool Interface - Integration Tests). Check: overall code quality, feature completeness, integration with the rest of the codebase, and pattern reuse / code duplication. Verify that integration tests actually exercise the improved tool interfaces from P25.M2 and that edge cases (errors, large outputs, timeouts) are covered.
