Load the review-and-fix skill. Review all epics and tasks under P25.M1 (MCP Tool Interface - Research & Audit). Check: overall code quality, feature completeness, integration with the rest of the codebase, and pattern reuse / code duplication. Key areas: audit findings from opencode/codex/crush MCP tool interfaces and the documented best-practice patterns. Verify findings were actually used to inform P25.M2 improvements.
