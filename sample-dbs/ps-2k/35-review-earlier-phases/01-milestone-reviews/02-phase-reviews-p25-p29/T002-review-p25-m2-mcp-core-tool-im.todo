Load the review-and-fix skill. Review all epics and tasks under P25.M2 (MCP Tool Interface - Core Tool Improvements). Check: overall code quality, feature completeness, integration with the rest of the codebase, and pattern reuse / code duplication. Key areas: improvements to bash_tool/execute_shell (argument shapes, output handling), file editing tools (edit, glob, read, write), and spawn_subagent tool interface. Verify argument schemas are sensible, descriptions are accurate and helpful, and error messages are informative.
