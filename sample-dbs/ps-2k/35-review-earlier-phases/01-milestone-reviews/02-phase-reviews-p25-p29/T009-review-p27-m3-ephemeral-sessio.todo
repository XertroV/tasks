Load the review-and-fix skill. Review all epics and tasks under P27.M3 (Ephemeral Session Spawning - Tests). Check: overall code quality, feature completeness, integration with the rest of the codebase, and pattern reuse / code duplication. Verify that lifecycle tests cover: ephemeral session creation, auto-cleanup after completion, that in-progress sessions are not prematurely destroyed, and cron-triggered ephemeral session teardown.
