# Register /dashboard/llm-calls route and add card to DashboardIndex



## Requirements

- The new LLM calls dashboard must be reachable via the application router under the authenticated dashboard scope, and discoverable from the main dashboard index page.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `lib/pag_server_web/router.ex` contains a `live` route mapping `"/dashboard/llm-calls"` to `PagServerWeb.LlmCallsDashboardLive` with action `:index`, placed inside the authenticated `live_session` scope that contains other dashboard routes (around line ~959).
- Navigating to `/dashboard/llm-calls` without a valid session redirects to the login page (enforced by the `live_session` scope's `on_mount` hook).
- `lib/pag_server_web/live/dashboard_index.ex` includes a new card for the LLM Calls dashboard.
- The card's title (or heading) is `"LLM Calls"` (exact string).
- The card contains the description text `"Monitor LLM requests — token usage, cost, timing"` (exact string).
- The card links to `"/dashboard/llm-calls"` (using `~p"/dashboard/llm-calls"` or equivalent verified route helper).
- `mix phx.routes` lists `GET /dashboard/llm-calls` (or `LIVE /dashboard/llm-calls`) without error.
- No compiler warnings are introduced; all existing router and dashboard index tests continue to pass.
