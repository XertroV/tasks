# Add mix test.llm_calls alias to mix.exs



## Requirements

- Add a `mix test.llm_calls` alias to `mix.exs` so developers can run the LLM call records test files in one command
- Alias must target both the recorder test and the schema test

## Acceptance Criteria

- `mix.exs` contains an entry in the `aliases/0` (or equivalent) function with the key `"test.llm_calls"`
- The alias value runs: `["test test/pag_server/llm/call_recorder_test.exs test/pag_server/schema/llm_call_record_test.exs"]` (or equivalent formulation that passes both paths to `mix test`)
- Running `mix test.llm_calls` from the project root executes exactly those two test files and no others
- Running `mix test.llm_calls` exits 0 when both test files pass
- The alias follows the same formatting and style as the other `test.*` aliases already present in `mix.exs` (e.g., `test.agents`, `test.sessions`, etc.)
- `mix compile` produces no errors after the change
