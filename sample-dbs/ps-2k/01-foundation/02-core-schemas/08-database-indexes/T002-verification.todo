# Verify indexes are used by queries

Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on common queries to verify the new indexes are being used correctly.

## Requirements
- [ ] Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on stats aggregation queries
- [ ] Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on message chain verification queries
- [ ] Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on event filtering queries
- [ ] Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on pending tool calls queries
- [ ] Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on session fork queries
- [ ] Verify no sequential scans on indexed columns

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All new indexes show up in query plans
- [ ] No unexpected sequential scans
- [ ] Document query patterns and their indexes

## Implementation Notes
This task requires running the migrations first and then executing test queries.
