## Summary
Render Response.options as interactive platform-native UI elements for the /model command.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Telegram: options rendered as inline keyboard buttons (callback queries); selecting a button triggers model switch
- [ ] Telegram CallbackHandler updated to handle model-switch callbacks
- [ ] Slack: options rendered as Block Kit select menu
- [ ] Discord: options rendered as ephemeral select component or listed as text with buttons
- [ ] Web: options rendered as clickable list items (response metadata carries options for frontend)
- [ ] Plain-text fallback: options listed as numbered text list when platform has no interactive support
