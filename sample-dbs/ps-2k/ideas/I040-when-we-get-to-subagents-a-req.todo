# Idea Intake: When we get to subagents, a required field should be 'size' which could be small, medium, or large. (or a model could be provided and then size can be omitted). the user can specify a pool of models that fall into each size. This makes choosing models easier. Workspace level setting (small/med/large) models.

## Original Idea

When we get to subagents, a required field should be 'size' which could be small, medium, or large. (or a model could be provided and then size can be omitted). the user can specify a pool of models that fall into each size. This makes choosing models easier. Workspace level setting (small/med/large) models.

## Planning Task (Equivalent of /plan-task)

- Run `/plan-task "When we get to subagents, a required field should be 'size' which could be small, medium, or large. (or a model could be provided and then size can be omitted). the user can specify a pool of models that fall into each size. This makes choosing models easier. Workspace level setting (small/med/large) models."` to decompose this idea into actionable work.
- Confirm placement in the current `.tasks` hierarchy before creating work items.

## Ingest Plan Into .tasks

- Create implementation items with `tasks add` and related hierarchy commands (`tasks add-epic`, `tasks add-milestone`, `tasks add-phase`) as needed.
- Create follow-up defects with `tasks bug` when bug-style work is identified.
- Record all created IDs below and wire dependencies.

## Created Work Items

- P26 (Phase): Agent Size Pool
  - P26.M1.E1.T001: Add size pool config to workspace schema (small/medium/large model lists)
  - P26.M1.E1.T002: Add size field to agent spawn requests
  - P26.M2.E1.T001: Implement model selector that picks from workspace size pool
  - P26.M2.E2.T001: API for configuring workspace model pools (get/set per size)
  - P26.M3.E1.T001: Tests for size-based model selection (end-to-end)

## Completion Criteria

- Idea has been decomposed into concrete `.tasks` work items.
- New items include clear acceptance criteria and dependencies.
- This idea intake is updated with created IDs and marked done.
