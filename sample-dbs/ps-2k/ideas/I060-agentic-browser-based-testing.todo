# Idea Intake: agentic browser based testing of all major features, plugins, teams, worktrees, pair coding, etc. opportunity for deep iterative work and fixes.

## Original Idea

agentic browser based testing of all major features, plugins, teams, worktrees, pair coding, etc. opportunity for deep iterative work and fixes.

## Planning Task (Equivalent of /plan-task)

- Run `/plan-task "agentic browser based testing of all major features, plugins, teams, worktrees, pair coding, etc. opportunity for deep iterative work and fixes."` to decompose this idea into actionable work.
- Confirm placement in the current `.tasks` hierarchy before creating work items.

## Ingest Plan Into .tasks

- Create implementation items with `tasks add` and related hierarchy commands (`tasks add-epic`, `tasks add-milestone`, `tasks add-phase`) as needed.
- Create follow-up defects with `tasks bug` when bug-style work is identified.
- Record all created IDs below and wire dependencies.

## Created Work Items

### Phase P51: Agentic Browser Testing (18h estimate, 3 weeks)

**M1: Team Infrastructure**
- P51.M1.E1.T001 — Create docs/browser-testing/TEAM.md (team CLAUDE.md, roles, bug format, handoff protocol)
- P51.M1.E1.T002 — Create docs/browser-testing/explorer-guide.md
- P51.M1.E1.T003 — Create docs/browser-testing/fix-agent-guide.md
- P51.M1.E1.T004 — Create scripts/run-browser-testing-team.sh (prereq checker + instructions)
- P51.M1.E1.T005 — Implement 'backlog fixed' CLI command (or shell wrapper)

**M2: Exploratory Testing Campaigns** (simple → complex within each epic)

E1: Core UI Exploration
- P51.M2.E1.T001 — Level 1: Navigation sanity & page load audit (all pages load?)
- P51.M2.E1.T002 — Level 2: Auth flow & setup wizard (login, onboarding)
- P51.M2.E1.T003 — Level 3: Agent CRUD & validation console basic (create agent, send msg)
- P51.M2.E1.T004 — Level 4: Sessions, forking, event browser & LLM calls dashboard
- P51.M2.E1.T005 — Level 5: Settings, workspace management & streaming edge cases

E2: Plugin UI Exploration
- P51.M2.E2.T001 — Level 1-2: Skill Hub, Models/Pricing & Graphiti Wall
- P51.M2.E2.T002 — Level 3-4: Pair programming plugin — session creation and role management
- P51.M2.E2.T003 — Level 5: Device auth flow, LLM provider config, & tool approvals

**M3: Fix Loop**
- P51.M3.E1.T001 — Triage M2 bugs: assign P0/P1/P2/P3 severity & group by area
- P51.M3.E2.T001 — Fix P0 and P1 bugs from triage (fix agents run in parallel)
- P51.M3.E2.T002 — Verification pass & Playwright scenario notes

### Key Design Decisions
- Explorers should EXPECT missing/broken features (pre-alpha) — file everything
- 'backlog fixed B_xxx' registers inline quick fixes during exploration
- Single Chrome instance, explicit 'You have the browser' handoff from Team Lead
- Scenarios progress Level 1→5 (simple to complex) within each explorer's area
- Bug reports must include Playwright scenario stubs for future regression tests

## Completion Criteria

- [x] Idea has been decomposed into concrete `.tasks` work items.
- [x] New items include clear acceptance criteria and dependencies.
- [x] This idea intake is updated with created IDs and marked done.
