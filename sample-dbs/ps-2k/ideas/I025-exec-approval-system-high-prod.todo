# Idea Intake: Exec Approval System | HIGH | Production safety. Dangerous commands require explicit approval via WebSocket. Critical for enterprise trust.

## Original Idea

Exec Approval System | HIGH | Production safety. Dangerous commands require explicit approval via WebSocket. Critical for enterprise trust.

## Planning Task (Equivalent of /plan-task)

- Run `/plan-task "Exec Approval System | HIGH | Production safety. Dangerous commands require explicit approval via WebSocket. Critical for enterprise trust."` to decompose this idea into actionable work.
- Confirm placement in the current `.tasks` hierarchy before creating work items.

## Ingest Plan Into .tasks

- Create implementation items with `tasks add` and related hierarchy commands (`tasks add-epic`, `tasks add-milestone`, `tasks add-phase`) as needed.
- Create follow-up defects with `tasks bug` when bug-style work is identified.
- Record all created IDs below and wire dependencies.

## Created Work Items

- P23.M1 (Exec Approval System)
- P23.M1.E1 (Command Classifier — tasks not yet created)

- P23.M1.E3 (Phoenix Channel Integration — tasks not yet created)
- P23.M1.E4 (Config, API & Tests — tasks not yet created)

## Completion Criteria

- Idea has been decomposed into concrete `.tasks` work items.
- New items include clear acceptance criteria and dependencies.
- This idea intake is updated with created IDs and marked done.
