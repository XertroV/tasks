# Idea Intake: Agents need a setting for epheremal or persistent execution modes. Ask the user questions about this to understand exactly what this means.

## Original Idea

Agents need a setting for epheremal or persistent execution modes. Ask the user questions about this to understand exactly what this means.

## Planning Task (Equivalent of /plan-task)

- Run `/plan-task "Agents need a setting for epheremal or persistent execution modes. Ask the user questions about this to understand exactly what this means."` to decompose this idea into actionable work.
- Confirm placement in the current `.tasks` hierarchy before creating work items.

## Ingest Plan Into .tasks

- Create implementation items with `tasks add` and related hierarchy commands (`tasks add-epic`, `tasks add-milestone`, `tasks add-phase`) as needed.
- Create follow-up defects with `tasks bug` when bug-style work is identified.
- Record all created IDs below and wire dependencies.

## Created Work Items

- P36 (Agent Execution Modes — already done)
- P36.M1 (Core Infrastructure)
- P36.M1.E1 (Schema & Migrations)
- P36.M1.E2 (Pure Logic Modules)
- P36.M1.E3 (SessionStore Query)
- P36.M1.E4 (BootManager GenServer)
- P36.M1.E5 (AgentWaker)
- P36.M2 (UI)
- P36.M2.E1 (Agent Manager UI)

## Completion Criteria

- Idea has been decomposed into concrete `.tasks` work items.
- New items include clear acceptance criteria and dependencies.
- This idea intake is updated with created IDs and marked done.
