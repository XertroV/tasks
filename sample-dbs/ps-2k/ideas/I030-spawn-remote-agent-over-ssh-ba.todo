# Idea Intake: Spawn remote agent over SSH. basically just run the pseudo-vpn remote mcp thing and bam, your agent can control another agent 'on' a remote machine. Trying to integrate it with the main agent or whatever might be a PITA but easy to get another agent to do it.

## Original Idea

Spawn remote agent over SSH. basically just run the pseudo-vpn remote mcp thing and bam, your agent can control another agent 'on' a remote machine. Trying to integrate it with the main agent or whatever might be a PITA but easy to get another agent to do it.

## Planning Task (Equivalent of /plan-task)

- Run `/plan-task "Spawn remote agent over SSH. basically just run the pseudo-vpn remote mcp thing and bam, your agent can control another agent 'on' a remote machine. Trying to integrate it with the main agent or whatever might be a PITA but easy to get another agent to do it."` to decompose this idea into actionable work.
- Confirm placement in the current `.tasks` hierarchy before creating work items.

## Ingest Plan Into .tasks

- Create implementation items with `tasks add` and related hierarchy commands (`tasks add-epic`, `tasks add-milestone`, `tasks add-phase`) as needed.
- Create follow-up defects with `tasks bug` when bug-style work is identified.
- Record all created IDs below and wire dependencies.

## Created Work Items

- P31.M1 (SSH Remote Agent)
- P31.M1.E1 (SSH Connection & Port Forwarding)
- P31.M1.E1.T001 (Add SshConfig schema and migration)
- P31.M1.E1.T002 (Implement SshTunnel GenServer)
- P31.M1.E1.T003 (Implement SshSupervisor)
- P31.M1.E1.T004 (Write SshTunnel tests)
- P31.M1.E2 (Remote MCP Tool & Plugin)
- P31.M1.E2.T001 (Implement remote_agent_spawn MCP tool)
- P31.M1.E2.T002 (Implement SshPlugin module)
- P31.M1.E2.T003 (Add SSH REST API endpoints)
- P31.M1.E2.T004 (Write SSH plugin and API tests)

## Completion Criteria

- Idea has been decomposed into concrete `.tasks` work items.
- New items include clear acceptance criteria and dependencies.
- This idea intake is updated with created IDs and marked done.
