# Idea Intake: Plugin security and trust hardening strategy (planning first): evaluate provenance/signing, capability permissions, policy controls, and operational safeguards before implementation. References: docs/plans/2026-02-20-plugin-platform-remediation-plan.md and docs/plans/2026-02-20-plugin-security-model.md

## Original Idea

Plugin security and trust hardening strategy (planning first): evaluate provenance/signing, capability permissions, policy controls, and operational safeguards before implementation. References: docs/plans/2026-02-20-plugin-platform-remediation-plan.md and docs/plans/2026-02-20-plugin-security-model.md

## Planning Task (Equivalent of /plan-task)

- Run `/plan-task "Plugin security and trust hardening strategy (planning first): evaluate provenance/signing, capability permissions, policy controls, and operational safeguards before implementation. References: docs/plans/2026-02-20-plugin-platform-remediation-plan.md and docs/plans/2026-02-20-plugin-security-model.md"` to decompose this idea into actionable work.
- Confirm placement in the current `.tasks` hierarchy before creating work items.

## Ingest Plan Into .tasks

- Create implementation items with `tasks add` and related hierarchy commands (`tasks add-epic`, `tasks add-milestone`, `tasks add-phase`) as needed.
- Create follow-up defects with `tasks bug` when bug-style work is identified.
- Record all created IDs below and wire dependencies.

## Created Work Items

- Planning docs created and linked:
  - `docs/plans/2026-02-20-plugin-platform-remediation-plan.md`
  - `docs/plans/2026-02-20-plugin-security-model.md`
- Planning path:
  - `P49` Plugin Platform Remediation
  - `P49.M4` Plugin Security and Trust Strategy Planning
  - `P49.M4.E1` Plan the plugin security and trust hardening direction
  - `P49.M4.E1.T001` Evaluate security/trust options and propose implementation path
- Option B implementation path (must land before Option C):
  - `P49.M5` Plugin Trust Baseline (Option B)
  - `P49.M5.E1` Trust policy and provenance foundation
    - `P49.M5.E1.T001` Define trust policy schema risk tiers and reason-code contract
    - `P49.M5.E1.T002` Add plugin provenance persistence model and migrations
    - `P49.M5.E1.T003` Implement PluginTrustVerifier behaviour and shared verification interface
  - `P49.M5.E2` Option B verifier and policy enforcement
    - `P49.M5.E2.T001` Add explicit dev and unpublished override flow with TTL and audit
    - `P49.M5.E2.T002` Enforce trusted publisher and source policy with verified-only mode
    - `P49.M5.E2.T003` Implement checksum verification in plugin install and update pipeline
    - `P49.M5.E2.T004` Apply capability-aware trust gates across lifecycle and tool execution
  - `P49.M5.E3` Trust observability incident tooling and docs sync
    - `P49.M5.E3.T001` Emit structured trust events and wire telemetry handlers
    - `P49.M5.E3.T002` Update trust docs and add adversarial regression tests for Option B
    - `P49.M5.E3.T003` Build plugin trust report command or API for incident reconstruction
- Option C implementation path (depends on Option B milestone):
  - `P49.M6` Plugin Signature Hardening (Option C)
  - `P49.M6.E1` Sigstore and cosign verification backend
    - `P49.M6.E1.T001` Add signature verification failure diagnostics and regression tests
    - `P49.M6.E1.T002` Implement Sigstore verifier adapter with cosign integration
    - `P49.M6.E1.T003` Map signature identity claims into trust policy decisions
  - `P49.M6.E2` Pluggable trust endpoints and local-only verification mode
    - `P49.M6.E2.T001` Implement local-only verification mode with managed trust roots
    - `P49.M6.E2.T002` Implement configurable trust endpoint profiles for public and private Sigstore
    - `P49.M6.E2.T003` Add verifier backend selection and deterministic fallback chain
  - `P49.M6.E3` Attestations progressive enforcement and migration
    - `P49.M6.E3.T001` Implement progressive enforcement modes and break-glass exceptions
    - `P49.M6.E3.T002` Define attestation policy contract and verify for high-risk plugin tiers
    - `P49.M6.E3.T003` Publish migration and operations playbook for Option B to Option C
- Dependency ordering:
  - `P49.M5` depends on `P49.M4`
  - `P49.M6` depends on `P49.M5`

## Completion Criteria

- Idea has been decomposed into concrete `.tasks` work items.
- New items include clear acceptance criteria and dependencies.
- This idea intake is updated with created IDs and marked done.
