# Idea Intake: Integrate with openclaw skill registry (in webui)

## Original Idea

Integrate with openclaw skill registry (in webui)

Also integrate with other big popular skill registries.

## Planning Task (Equivalent of /plan-task)

- Run `/plan-task "Integrate with openclaw skill registry (in webui)"` to decompose this idea into actionable work.
- Confirm placement in the current `.tasks` hierarchy before creating work items.

## Ingest Plan Into .tasks

- Create implementation items with `tasks add` and related hierarchy commands (`tasks add-epic`, `tasks add-milestone`, `tasks add-phase`) as needed.
- Create follow-up defects with `tasks bug` when bug-style work is identified.
- Record all created IDs below and wire dependencies.

## Research Findings

### OpenClaw / ClawHub

- **ClawHub** (clawhub.ai) is the public skill registry for OpenClaw
- Skills use **AgentSkills-compatible format**: `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter
- Required frontmatter: `name`, `description`
- OpenClaw extensions in `metadata.openclaw`:
  - `requires.bins` - Required binaries on PATH
  - `requires.env` - Required environment variables
  - `requires.config` - Required config keys
  - `install` - Installation instructions (brew/node/go/uv/download)

### ClawHub API

- Base URL: `https://clawhub.ai/api/v1`
- Endpoints (inferred from docs):
  - `GET /skills` - List skills (paginated)
  - `GET /skills?q=query` - Search skills
  - `GET /skills/:slug` - Get skill details
  - `GET /skills/:slug/download` - Download skill bundle
- CLI tool: `npm i -g clawhub`

### Other Skill Registries

- **AgentSkills.io** - Specification that OpenClaw follows
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** - More of a protocol than a registry
- **LangChain tools** - Tool ecosystem, no unified registry
- Most "plugin" systems are tool-specific, not cross-platform

### PAG Server Integration Points

- Existing `PagServer.Plugins.Marketplace` context with caching pattern
- Existing `PagServer.Plugins.Installer` for URL/registry installation
- Plugin Hub UI exists under milestone P28
- Skills are different from plugins (prompt instructions vs. code execution)

## Proposed Architecture

```
PagServer.Skills
├── ClawHub
│   ├── Client          # HTTP client for ClawHub API
│   └── Context         # Public API wrapper
├── Parser              # SKILL.md format parser
├── Skill               # Skill struct and validation
├── Requirements        # Requirements checker
└── Registry            # Behaviour for multi-registry support

PagServerWeb
└── SkillHubLive        # LiveView for skill browsing
```
