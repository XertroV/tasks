# Idea Intake: Refactor how plugins work so we don't tneed plugin files under lib/, eg lib/pag_server/plugins/*

## Original Idea

Refactor how plugins work so we don't tneed plugin files under lib/, eg lib/pag_server/plugins/*

## Planning Task (Equivalent of /plan-task)

- Run `/plan-task "Refactor how plugins work so we don't tneed plugin files under lib/, eg lib/pag_server/plugins/*"` to decompose this idea into actionable work.
- Confirm placement in the current `.tasks` hierarchy before creating work items.

## Ingest Plan Into .tasks

- Create implementation items with `tasks add` and related hierarchy commands (`tasks add-epic`, `tasks add-milestone`, `tasks add-phase`) as needed.
- Create follow-up defects with `tasks bug` when bug-style work is identified.
- Record all created IDs below and wire dependencies.

## Created Work Items

- P23.M3 (Plugin File Structure Refactor)
- P23.M3.E1 (Plugin Directory Structure — tasks not yet created)
- P23.M3.E2 (PluginLoader Update & Migration — tasks not yet created)
- P23.M3.E3 (Verification & Documentation — tasks not yet created)

## Completion Criteria

- Idea has been decomposed into concrete `.tasks` work items.
- New items include clear acceptance criteria and dependencies.
- This idea intake is updated with created IDs and marked done.
