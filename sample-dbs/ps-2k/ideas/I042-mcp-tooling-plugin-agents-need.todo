# Idea Intake: MCP/tooling/plugin: Agents need to be able to query for connectors they have access to + send arbitrary messages over arbitrary connectors. Like an agent might have a task to check for new tweets on topic Y and send me a list of the top 5 on whatsapp. Ideally we can write this as a plugin.

## Original Idea

MCP/tooling/plugin: Agents need to be able to query for connectors they have access to + send arbitrary messages over arbitrary connectors. Like an agent might have a task to check for new tweets on topic Y and send me a list of the top 5 on whatsapp. Ideally we can write this as a plugin.

## Planning Task (Equivalent of /plan-task)

- Run `/plan-task "MCP/tooling/plugin: Agents need to be able to query for connectors they have access to + send arbitrary messages over arbitrary connectors. Like an agent might have a task to check for new tweets on topic Y and send me a list of the top 5 on whatsapp. Ideally we can write this as a plugin."` to decompose this idea into actionable work.
- Confirm placement in the current `.tasks` hierarchy before creating work items.

## Ingest Plan Into .tasks

- Create implementation items with `tasks add` and related hierarchy commands (`tasks add-epic`, `tasks add-milestone`, `tasks add-phase`) as needed.
- Create follow-up defects with `tasks bug` when bug-style work is identified.
- Record all created IDs below and wire dependencies.

## Created Work Items

New phase P38 (Connector Messaging Plugin) with 1 milestone and 3 epics:

**P38.M1.E1 — Plugin scaffold and connector registry**
- P38.M1.E1.T001: Create plugin scaffold (plugin.json, ConnectorPlugin module)
- P38.M1.E1.T002: Implement ConnectorRegistry: list_workspace_connectors/1 and get_connector/2
- P38.M1.E1.T003: Implement list_connectors MCP tool

**P38.M1.E2 — Outbound message dispatch and tests**
- P38.M1.E2.T001: Implement ConnectorDispatcher: dispatch/3 with per-platform routing
- P38.M1.E2.T002: Implement send_connector_message MCP tool
- P38.M1.E2.T003: Tests for ConnectorRegistry, ConnectorDispatcher, and MCP tools

**P38.M1.E3 — Security, auth, and integration**
- P38.M1.E3.T001: Enforce workspace-scoped connector access (security guard in dispatcher)
- P38.M1.E3.T002: Add rate limiting for outbound connector messages (per workspace)
- P38.M1.E3.T003: Documentation: PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT.md update and connector_messaging/README.md

## Completion Criteria

- Idea has been decomposed into concrete `.tasks` work items.
- New items include clear acceptance criteria and dependencies.
- This idea intake is updated with created IDs and marked done.
