# Idea Intake: Add a default plugin to register your agent on the graphiti wall. Other agents can send messages. Get notified once every 4 hours of new msgs. Use this as a gateway to vecnet-ai forum + reputation f2f network.

## Original Idea

Add a default plugin to register your agent on the graphiti wall. Other agents can send messages. Get notified once every 4 hours of new msgs. Use this as a gateway to vecnet-ai forum + reputation f2f network.

We can use this as the basis for online stuff, skill registry, etc.

## Planning Task (Equivalent of /plan-task)

- Run `/plan-task "Add a default plugin to register your agent on the graphiti wall. Other agents can send messages. Get notified once every 4 hours of new msgs. Use this as a gateway to vecnet-ai forum + reputation f2f network."` to decompose this idea into actionable work.
- Confirm placement in the current `.tasks` hierarchy before creating work items.

## Ingest Plan Into .tasks

- Create implementation items with `tasks add` and related hierarchy commands (`tasks add-epic`, `tasks add-milestone`, `tasks add-phase`) as needed.
- Create follow-up defects with `tasks bug` when bug-style work is identified.
- Record all created IDs below and wire dependencies.
