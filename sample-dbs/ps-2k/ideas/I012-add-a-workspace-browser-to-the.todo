# Idea Intake: Add a workspace browser to the webui dashboard that shows all workspaces, allows you to edit workspace configuration, enable/disable plugins, skills, etc. Lets get creative and brainstorm some amazing ideas!

## Original Idea

Add a workspace browser to the webui dashboard that shows all workspaces, allows you to edit workspace configuration, enable/disable plugins, skills, etc. Lets get creative and brainstorm some amazing ideas!

## Planning Task (Equivalent of /plan-task)

- Run `/plan-task "Add a workspace browser to the webui dashboard that shows all workspaces, allows you to edit workspace configuration, enable/disable plugins, skills, etc. Lets get creative and brainstorm some amazing ideas!"` to decompose this idea into actionable work.
- Confirm placement in the current `.tasks` hierarchy before creating work items.

## Ingest Plan Into .tasks

- Create implementation items with `tasks add` and related hierarchy commands (`tasks add-epic`, `tasks add-milestone`, `tasks add-phase`) as needed.
- Create follow-up defects with `tasks bug` when bug-style work is identified.
- Record all created IDs below and wire dependencies.

## Created Work Items

- Epic: `P15.M2.E7` - Workspace Browser Control Center
- Tasks:
  - `P15.M2.E7.T001` Define workspace browser IA and permission model
  - `P15.M2.E7.T002` Create workspace browser query surface and view models
  - `P15.M2.E7.T003` Build dashboard workspace browser with search and status lanes
  - `P15.M2.E7.T004` Implement inline workspace config editor with staged changes
  - `P15.M2.E7.T005` Add plugin and skill toggles with dependency guardrails
  - `P15.M2.E7.T006` Add workspace command palette and quick actions
  - `P15.M2.E7.T007` Add change preview and rollback timeline for workspace operations
  - `P15.M2.E7.T008` Cover workspace browser with integration tests and operator playbook
  - `P15.M2.E7.T009` Add edit checkpoints with version labels and rollback anchors
- Bugs: none

## Planning Notes

- IA in this plan means information architecture: how the workspace browser organizes navigation, grouping, and action placement for operator workflows.

## Completion Criteria

- Idea has been decomposed into concrete `.tasks` work items.
- New items include clear acceptance criteria and dependencies.
- This idea intake is updated with created IDs and marked done.
