# Idea Intake: Create MCP server (stdio) for PAG API. Maybe a new package -- pac-mcp?

## Original Idea

Create MCP server (stdio) for PAG API. Maybe a new package -- pac-mcp?

## Planning Task (Equivalent of /plan-task)

- Run `/plan-task "Create MCP server (stdio) for PAG API. Maybe a new package -- pac-mcp?"` to decompose this idea into actionable work.
- Confirm placement in the current `.tasks` hierarchy before creating work items.

## Ingest Plan Into .tasks

- Create implementation items with `tasks add` and related hierarchy commands (`tasks add-epic`, `tasks add-milestone`, `tasks add-phase`) as needed.
- Create follow-up defects with `tasks bug` when bug-style work is identified.
- Record all created IDs below and wire dependencies.

## Created Work Items

- Created phase: `P52` (PAG API MCP Server (stdio))
- Created milestones: `P52.M1`, `P52.M2` (depends on `P52.M1`), `P52.M3` (depends on `P52.M2`)
- Created epics: `P52.M1.E1`, `P52.M2.E1`, `P52.M2.E2`, `P52.M3.E1`
- Created tasks:
  - `P52.M1.E1.T001` Write MCP stdio contract and capability matrix
  - `P52.M1.E1.T002` Decide package layout and bootstrap command
  - `P52.M1.E1.T003` Scaffold server entrypoint and baseline config
  - `P52.M2.E1.T001` Implement MCP initialize, health, and list-tools handlers
  - `P52.M2.E1.T002` Implement tool-call dispatch to PAG API endpoints
  - `P52.M2.E1.T003` Normalize API and transport errors into MCP responses
  - `P52.M2.E2.T001` Implement auth/config loading for stdio runtime
  - `P52.M2.E2.T002` Add workspace and session target resolution
  - `P52.M3.E1.T001` Add unit/integration tests for MCP stdio flows
  - `P52.M3.E1.T002` Document setup, auth, and example client wiring
  - `P52.M3.E1.T003` Run lint/targeted tests and capture launch checklist
- Created bug IDs: none

## Completion Criteria

- Idea has been decomposed into concrete `.tasks` work items.
- New items include clear acceptance criteria and dependencies.
- This idea intake is updated with created IDs and marked done.
