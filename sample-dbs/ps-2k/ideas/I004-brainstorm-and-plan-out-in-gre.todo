# Idea Intake: Brainstorm and plan out in great detail a simple web app that acts as a frontend for pag-server, useful for testing and quick validation, running agents quickly for testing, etc. Needs a chat interface and some buttons for tool stuff, some simple settings to configure things, a browser to list sessions or whatever agents are grouped by, etc.

## Original Idea

Brainstorm and plan out in great detail a simple web app that acts as a frontend for pag-server, useful for testing and quick validation, running agents quickly for testing, etc. Needs a chat interface and some buttons for tool stuff, some simple settings to configure things, a browser to list sessions or whatever agents are grouped by, etc.

## Planning Task (Equivalent of /plan-task)

- Run `/plan-task "Brainstorm and plan out in great detail a simple web app that acts as a frontend for pag-server, useful for testing and quick validation, running agents quickly for testing, etc. Needs a chat interface and some buttons for tool stuff, some simple settings to configure things, a browser to list sessions or whatever agents are grouped by, etc."` to decompose this idea into actionable work.
- Confirm placement in the current `.tasks` hierarchy before creating work items.

## Ingest Plan Into .tasks

- Create implementation items with `tasks add` and related hierarchy commands (`tasks add-epic`, `tasks add-milestone`, `tasks add-phase`) as needed.
- Create follow-up defects with `tasks bug` when bug-style work is identified.
- Record all created IDs below and wire dependencies.

## Created Work Items

- Epic: P15.M2.E4 (Rapid Validation Web Console)
- Tasks:
  - P15.M2.E4.T001 Define validation console scope and API interaction map
  - P15.M2.E4.T002 Scaffold Phoenix LiveView console shell with responsive layout
  - P15.M2.E4.T003 Implement chat workspace with streaming transcript and input composer
  - P15.M2.E4.T004 Build sessions and agents browser with filtering and grouping
  - P15.M2.E4.T005 Add quick action buttons for tool invocation and test presets
  - P15.M2.E4.T006 Create settings panel for provider, model, and runtime options
  - P15.M2.E4.T007 Implement run controls for new session, fork, stop, and retry flows
  - P15.M2.E4.T008 Add lightweight event timeline for messages and tool activity
  - P15.M2.E4.T009 Harden UX with loading, error handling, and empty states
  - P15.M2.E4.T010 Cover console with integration tests and rapid validation smoke script
  - P15.M2.E4.T011 Document local usage workflows for quick validation sessions
- Add created bug IDs (if any)

## Completion Criteria

- Idea has been decomposed into concrete `.tasks` work items.
- New items include clear acceptance criteria and dependencies.
- This idea intake is updated with created IDs and marked done.
