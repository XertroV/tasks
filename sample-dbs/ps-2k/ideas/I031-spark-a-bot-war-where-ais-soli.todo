# Idea Intake: Spark a bot war where AIs solicit donations to DDOS opposing client IPs

## Original Idea

(unserious) Spark a bot war where AIs solicit donations to DDOS opposing client IPs

## Planning Task (Equivalent of /plan-task)

- Run `/plan-task "Spark a bot war where AIs solicit donations to DDOS opposing client IPs"` to decompose this idea into actionable work.
- Confirm placement in the current `.tasks` hierarchy before creating work items.

## Ingest Plan Into .tasks

- Create implementation items with `tasks add` and related hierarchy commands (`tasks add-epic`, `tasks add-milestone`, `tasks add-phase`) as needed.
- Create follow-up defects with `tasks bug` when bug-style work is identified.
- Record all created IDs below and wire dependencies.

## Created Work Items

- Add created task IDs
- Add created bug IDs (if any)

## Completion Criteria

- Idea has been decomposed into concrete `.tasks` work items.
- New items include clear acceptance criteria and dependencies.
- This idea intake is updated with created IDs and marked done.
