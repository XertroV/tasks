# Implement vector similarity queries

Build Elixir API for vector similarity search using pgvector distance operators.

## Requirements

- [ ] Create VectorSearch context module
- [ ] Implement cosine similarity search
- [ ] Implement L2 distance search
- [ ] Add filtering by metadata
- [ ] Support top-k retrieval with configurable limit

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Can search by cosine similarity: `<=> operator`
- [ ] Can search by L2 distance: `<-> operator`
- [ ] Returns top-k most similar vectors
- [ ] Supports metadata filtering (JSONB queries)
- [ ] Unit tests verify search accuracy
- [ ] Performance acceptable for 10k+ vectors

## Context

**Plan References**:
- `.plan/2026-02-05-velvet-cascade/integrations.md`
- `.plan/2026-02-05-velvet-cascade/architecture.md`

**Key Points**:
- Phase 9 focuses on advanced, future-oriented features
- All tasks marked as low priority (implement after core functionality)
- Memory efficiency targets apply: <512MB per session

## Notes

Example query:
```elixir
VectorSearch.find_similar(
  embedding,
  limit: 10,
  filters: %{"source_type" => "message"}
)
```

Distance operators in SQL:
- `ORDER BY embedding <=> $1` (cosine)
- `ORDER BY embedding <-> $1` (L2)


## Delegation Instructions

**Delegated to subagent by**: cli-user (primary agent)
**Delegation date**: 2026-02-11 02:42 UTC
**Primary task**: P9.M5.E4.T003 - Implement custom directive registration from plugins

**Instructions**:
This task was claimed as part of a multi-task batch. The primary agent (cli-user)
should spawn a subagent to complete this task in parallel.

**Recommended approach**:
1. Use the Task tool with subagent_type to create a dedicated agent
2. Provide context from this task file as the prompt
3. Grant necessary tools for task completion
4. Monitor subagent progress
5. Aggregate results upon completion

**Independence verification**:
- Different epic: ✓ (P9.M1.E1 vs P9.M5.E4)
- No dependency chain: ✓ (verified at claim time)
