# Configure HNSW indexing

Add HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) index to vector column for fast approximate nearest neighbor search.

## Requirements

- [ ] Create migration to add HNSW index
- [ ] Configure index parameters (m, ef_construction)
- [ ] Benchmark query performance vs sequential scan
- [ ] Document index build time and memory usage

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Index created: `CREATE INDEX ON embeddings USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops)`
- [ ] Query performance improves significantly (>10x for 10k+ vectors)
- [ ] Index parameters documented
- [ ] Tests verify index is used (EXPLAIN ANALYZE)

## Context

**Plan References**:
- `.plan/2026-02-05-velvet-cascade/integrations.md`
- `.plan/2026-02-05-velvet-cascade/architecture.md`

**Key Points**:
- Phase 9 focuses on advanced, future-oriented features
- All tasks marked as low priority (implement after core functionality)
- Memory efficiency targets apply: <512MB per session

## Notes

HNSW index significantly speeds up similarity search but increases insert time.

Example migration:
```sql
CREATE INDEX embeddings_hnsw_idx ON vector_embeddings 
USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops)
WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);
```

Parameters:
- m: max connections per layer (16 default, higher = better recall)
- ef_construction: build quality (64 default, higher = slower build, better quality)


## Delegation Instructions

**Delegated to subagent by**: cli-user (primary agent)
**Delegation date**: 2026-02-11 02:42 UTC
**Primary task**: P9.M5.E4.T003 - Implement custom directive registration from plugins

**Instructions**:
This task was claimed as part of a multi-task batch. The primary agent (cli-user)
should spawn a subagent to complete this task in parallel.

**Recommended approach**:
1. Use the Task tool with subagent_type to create a dedicated agent
2. Provide context from this task file as the prompt
3. Grant necessary tools for task completion
4. Monitor subagent progress
5. Aggregate results upon completion

**Independence verification**:
- Different epic: ✓ (P9.M1.E1 vs P9.M5.E4)
- No dependency chain: ✓ (verified at claim time)
