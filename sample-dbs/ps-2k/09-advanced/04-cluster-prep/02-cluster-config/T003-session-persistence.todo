# Ensure session persistence across nodes

Sessions must survive agent migration between nodes.

## Requirements

- [ ] Store state in database
- [ ] Recreate agents on new nodes
- [ ] Test failover scenarios
- [ ] Replay from event store
- [ ] Zero-downtime migrations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implementation complete
- [ ] Unit tests pass (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No compilation warnings
- [ ] Passes `mix credo --strict`

## Context

**Plan References**:
- `.plan/2026-02-05-velvet-cascade/integrations.md`
- `.plan/2026-02-05-velvet-cascade/architecture.md`

**Key Points**:
- Phase 9 is low priority - implement after core features
- Memory efficiency: <512MB per session, <4GB total
- All advanced features should be optional/configurable

## Notes

This is an advanced feature for Phase 9. Focus on core functionality first (Phases 1-6) before implementing.
