# Document setup, operational limits, and rollout checklist



## Requirements

- Document setup steps for companion-backed Browser MCP in dev and production-like environments.
- Capture operational limits, known caveats, and fallback behavior.
- Provide rollout checklist with verification and rollback guidance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Docs include end-to-end setup with required config/env examples.
- Known limitations section describes headless constraints and companion dependency.
- Launch checklist includes smoke tests, monitoring checks, and rollback steps.

## Execution Notes (2026-02-21)

- Added a BrowserMCP rollout runbook with setup prerequisites, runtime config
  examples, and companion registration expectations.
- Documented operational limits and deterministic error model including
  headless fallback caveats and companion dependency.
- Added explicit launch checklist sections for smoke tests, monitoring checks,
  and rollback steps.
