# Idea Intake: add 'bl fixed' as an easy way to add adhock fixes. store under path 'fixes/YYYY-MM/Fxyz-title-slug.md' (or .todo if easier for consistency)

## Original Idea

add 'bl fixed' as an easy way to add adhock fixes. store under path 'fixes/YYYY-MM/Fxyz-title-slug.md' (or .todo if easier for consistency)

## Planning Task (Equivalent of /plan-task)

- Run `/plan-task "add 'bl fixed' as an easy way to add adhock fixes. store under path 'fixes/YYYY-MM/Fxyz-title-slug.md' (or .todo if easier for consistency)"` to decompose this idea into actionable work.
- Confirm placement in the current `.tasks` hierarchy before creating work items.

## Ingest Plan Into .tasks

- Create implementation items with `tasks add` and related hierarchy commands (`tasks add-epic`, `tasks add-milestone`, `tasks add-phase`) as needed.
- Create follow-up defects with `tasks bug` when bug-style work is identified.
- Record all created IDs below and wire dependencies.

## Created Work Items

- Add created task IDs
- Add created bug IDs (if any)

## Completion Criteria

- Idea has been decomposed into concrete `.tasks` work items.
- New items include clear acceptance criteria and dependencies.
- This idea intake is updated with created IDs and marked done.
