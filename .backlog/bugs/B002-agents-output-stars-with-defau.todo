title: Agents output stars with 'Defaults' that isn't very good. We should add a h1
  before it (or change theh existing generic one) to say 'Work Loop & Task Backlog'.
  We can keep the 'Defaults' h2 along with the other h2s. This was for the medium
  profile but it's good for all of them i think. we should have a way to auto-apply
  and auto update agents.md too. We should use the new heading (or '## Defaults' to
  detect older entries) so we can intelligently update where suitable and not ruin
  existing AGENTS.md files.
