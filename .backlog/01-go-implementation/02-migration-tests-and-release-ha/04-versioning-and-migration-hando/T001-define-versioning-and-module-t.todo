# Define versioning and module tag strategy



## Requirements

- Implement "Define versioning and module tag strategy" in backlog_go with behavior matching existing Python/TypeScript parity expectations for that feature.
- Validate inputs, defaults, and failure modes relevant to this task, including malformed IDs, missing files, and incompatible status transitions.
- Keep file format and path handling consistent with the current backlog data model and migration assumptions in this repository.
- Ensure any generated/updated command or loader code is scoped to this task and does not introduce hidden side-effects on unrelated commands.

## Acceptance Criteria

- This task can be verified through deterministic output or test assertions tied to "Define versioning and module tag strategy" and the task id P1.M4.E4.T001.
- Edge-case and error-path behavior is covered by at least one unit test or fixture assertion.
- Parity checks against backlog.py/backlog_ts are updated or explicitly documented as equivalent for this scope.
- No placeholder TODO/acceptance/default content remains in this task file and `bl check` remains clean.
