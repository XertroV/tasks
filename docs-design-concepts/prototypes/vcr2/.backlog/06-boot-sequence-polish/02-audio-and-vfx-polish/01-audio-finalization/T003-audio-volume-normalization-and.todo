## Requirements
- Normalize all audio sources relative to each other
- Hierarchy: SFX (loudest) > ambient > tape hiss > room tone
- No clipping when multiple sources active simultaneously
## Acceptance Criteria
- No audio clipping in any scenario
- SFX clearly audible over ambients
- Master volume control scales all proportionally
- Mixed levels feel natural and balanced
