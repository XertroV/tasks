## Requirements
- completeTransition(): set isLoading, call loadPage, update currentPage/position
- After load: set VCR to PLAY, then PAUSED after 300ms
- Reset transition state to IDLE
- Error handling: keep current page on failure
## Acceptance Criteria
- After transition, currentPageId equals former targetPageId
- VCR goes PLAY then PAUSED 300ms later
- On loadPage failure, current page retained, state reset to IDLE
