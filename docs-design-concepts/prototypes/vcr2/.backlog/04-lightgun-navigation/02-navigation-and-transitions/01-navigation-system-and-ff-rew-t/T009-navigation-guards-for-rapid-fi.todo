## Requirements
- Reject navigateTo during active transition (with logging)
- Reject for missing pages, self-navigation
- cancelTransition() resets state to IDLE
- 5-second timeout auto-cancels stuck transitions
## Acceptance Criteria
- 3 rapid navigateTo calls results in exactly 1 transition
- Missing page doesn't crash, logs error
- cancelTransition mid-transition resets cleanly
- 5s timeout triggers auto-cancel
