## Requirements
- Test event trigger timing, variance bounds, conditions, duration tracking
- Test cleanup called exactly once, repeat events, priority ordering
- Test pause/resume, reset, seek, getState
- Test edge cases: zero deltaTime, time 0 event, large deltaTime

## Acceptance Criteria
- All test cases pass
- Tests run in under 2 seconds (manual tick calls)
- Deterministic (seeded random for variance tests)
- Edge cases covered
