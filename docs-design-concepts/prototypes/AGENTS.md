- When you see EPIC COMPLETE or MILESTONE COMPLETE, make sure to follow NEXT_STEPS and perform the corresponding review (and then also implement any fixes to address issues raised afterwards).
- Ensure that everything we can practically test is tested (and that tests run fast) so we can iterate and build confidently and with speed. 
- After each set of tasks you completed, ensure the build compiles and tests pass, and fix any issues that arise. Commit these fixes after you make them.
- After each set of tasks completed, you should always commit ALL changes.
