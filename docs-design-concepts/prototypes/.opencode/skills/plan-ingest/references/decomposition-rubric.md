# Decomposition Rubric

## Epic-Level Checks
- Epic objective is explicit and testable.
- Dependencies are directional and minimal.
- Scope has clear in/out boundaries.

## Task-Level Checks
- Task title is specific and bounded.
- Acceptance criteria are observable.
- Dependencies are concrete task IDs when known.
- Estimate and complexity are plausible for the scope.

## Consolidation Checks
- No duplicate tasks with overlapping acceptance criteria.
- Critical dependency chains are represented.
- Unknowns are surfaced instead of hidden as assumptions.
