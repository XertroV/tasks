# Hierarchy Reference

## Structure
Phase -> Milestone -> Epic -> Task

## ID Formats
- Phase: `P1`
- Milestone: `P1.M1`
- Epic: `P1.M1.E1`
- Task: `P1.M1.E1.T001`

## Placement Rules
- Keep tasks in the smallest coherent epic.
- Prefer extending existing epics when topic and dependency flow match.
- Create new epic when concern is distinct or epic would become too large.
- Create new milestone only when timeline and dependency boundaries justify it.
