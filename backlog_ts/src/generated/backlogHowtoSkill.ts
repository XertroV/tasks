# Backlog How-To

Skill-Version: 2026-02-23T09:36:08Z

Use this skill as an overview/manual for daily backlog operation.

## When To Use

- Use when you need command-level guidance for backlog workflows.
- Use when converting a rough idea into actionable backlog work.
- Use when coordinating claims, blockers, handoffs, and completion loops.

## Core Work Loop

1. Claim work:
   backlog grab
2. Read details:
   backlog show
3. Set active context when needed:
   backlog work TASK_ID
4. Implement work.
5. Complete:
   backlog done TASK_ID
6. Continue:
   backlog cycle

## Idea Workflow

1. Capture intake:
   backlog idea "idea title"
2. Decompose using plan-task flow:
   run /plan-task with the idea title
3. Ingest plan into hierarchy:
   backlog add, backlog add-epic, backlog add-milestone, backlog add-phase
4. Verify placement:
   backlog show PATH_ID
   backlog list --milestone M#

## Common Operations

- Explicit claim by known IDs:
  backlog claim TASK_ID TASK_ID
- Auto selection:
  backlog grab
- Mark blocked:
  backlog blocked --reason "message"
- Hand off:
  backlog handoff TASK_ID --to AGENT --notes "context"
- Analyze blockers:
  backlog blockers --suggest
  backlog why TASK_ID
- Preview queue:
  backlog preview
- Progress checks:
  backlog dash
  backlog report progress
  backlog report velocity --days 14

## Useful Arguments

- backlog grab:
  --single, --multi, --count N, --scope SCOPE, --agent AGENT
- backlog claim:
  --agent AGENT, --force
- backlog done:
  --verify, --force
- backlog cycle:
  optional TASK_ID, --agent AGENT
- backlog blocked:
  --reason is required, --no-grab optional

## Guardrails

- Do not assume positional arguments are valid for all commands.
- If a backlog command fails with argument/usage parsing, run exactly one recovery command:
  backlog cycle
- Prefer explicit claim for specific IDs:
  backlog claim TASK_ID TASK_ID
- Use backlog grab for automatic selection, not for explicit IDs.
- Keep Python, TypeScript, and Go behavior aligned when changing command semantics.
